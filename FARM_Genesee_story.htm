I was born in 1935 in the village of Hedge End, Hampshire, UK, first child of Sid and Ethel Tidridge. Dad was in the merchant navy, that is, he worked as a steward for a passenger shipping line. By 1937 a new home had been purchased in Totton, also in Hampshire. Both Hedge End and Totton are near Southampton a major shipping and then, passenger port.

I stayed at home with my parents and later a brother and sister, until I married in 1957, I had a normal, standard English education, starting at age 5 ending 3 months before my sixteenth birthday. A dropout! I was attending a technical school, where the basics of carpentry, plumbing and painting and decorating were taught. It was apparent I would never become a tradesman; I wanted to be a greenhouse gardener. My years at home covered WWII: we were aware of enemy action both locally and in Southampton, which was heavily bombed. Our immediate family escaped unscathed.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">1957 was a momentous year for me. Not only did I leave the army for the second time, having been recalled for the Suez Crises, I became a husband (for the first and only time!) to Maureen and left England to start a new life in Canada.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">I cannot escape Genesee! When you consider its size, the number of inhabitants, it seems incredible it would remain such a part of my life . When I joined the Edmont<img align="right" alt="The North Saskatchewan River, from Genesee" height="147" hspace="20" pbzloc="19" src="jtfarm06.jpg" style="height: 195px; width: 239px" vspace="20" width="150" />on Police service I met three people from or near Genesee, Kurt Stallknecht, Ron Maday and&nbsp; Vern Hobbs. Years later I visited the Genesee Community Hall for a Weed Inspectors&#39; Conference; I wandered into the kitchen and chatted to one of the helpers. I told her my experiences in Genesee; she turned out to be Fred&#39;s daughter, Mary. The Senior Weed Inspector I hired had work experience with the Greenhough family. And, as late as January 2009, chatting to a chap visiting our church, and being nosy, I wanted to know all about him. He was an engineer from Ontario but he had, get this, worked at the Genesee Power Station! I even saw the name Genesee in the credits for the movie (DVD) Phantom of the Opera!</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><img align="left" alt="Politician" height="175" hspace="20" pbzloc="20" src="jtfarm07.jpg" style="height: 224px; width: 205px" vspace="20" width="150" /> Immigrants!? It is fair to say those arriving in Canada in 1957 did not consider themselves &#39;immigrants&#39;. The word did and does have bad connotations. We considered ourselves as New Canadians coming to find a better life. And, of course, being British coming to the &#39;colonies&#39;, we had much to offer! (which we did of course!). I admit with some pride, I am now a Canadian citizen, and have been for over thirty years.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">I was neither poor (almost broke when I landed, but able to care for myself) disenfranchised nor persecuted: I came from good home, had a good education, and spoke the language (well, at least I thought I did!). In 1957 many folk left England for a better life. The Suez Canal Crises had raised fears of more wars and the work situation in the UK was not good. Canada, according to material given to me, was a land flowing with &#39;milk and honey&#39;! Weather was not mentioned!</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">1957 was about the time Canadians began to resent people coming from the UK and telling them how it was done better back &#39;home! Whether it was the superior British thing or not, I do not know. I hope I have learned my lesson(s). I was certainly put in my place when I was (later) working at Scott National Fruit Co.: we were at coffee (yes!!), and I was complaining how much better it was in the UK, a friend (now) also newly arrived said, &quot;If you don&#39;t like it here, you can blooming [sic!] well leave&quot;. I have not complained about our country since.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">One of the prevailing attitudes in the police service, was you only got promoted if you had an Anglo-Saxon surname. There was, perhaps, some merit to this argument. I knew of at least one person with a German sounding name who was complaining about his lack of promotion. I asked him if he had written the exams: he hadn&#39;t, I told him he had no reason to complain unless he had in fact written the exams. He did write, was promoted and finished with the rank of inspector. Just goes to show! I mention these things only to show there are several sides to most stories, and then there are the opinions we form based on pretty flimsy arguments!</span></p>

Marriage, through our children, has added an African-Cherokee husband, a Canadian-Finnish-English husband, a German-Canadian husband, Canadian-French wife, a Chinese-Canadian-English husband for a granddaughter, plus Canadian-German husband and two other granddaughters are courting lads from Central America.</span></p>

The years prior to 1957 and the trip to Canada had been interesting. I had in 1956, I completed three years with the Grenadier Guards; I was released in April but recalled in August for the Suez Canal crisis. I was shipped to Malta. I was engaged to be married. I moved from Malta to Egypt and then to Cyprus where I quickly began to read accumulated mail. Gadzooks, she&#39;s moving to Canada, Mum, Dad family and all,and no, they could not wait until I came home. It&#39;s December. Between December and February I come home, get married and with my wife and her family am booked on a ship for Canada. The ship trip across, in the &#39;Scythia&#39;, was our honeymoon.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">A train trip from Halifax to Vancouver, in a day coach, is worthy of recording. But I think not now! I finally arrive in Edmonton via Vancouver. (Don&#39;t ask!) I am in the Immigration facilities on 100 Street and 106 Avenue. I knew no one; I needed work. I had no trade but was willing to give anything a try. I had become accustomed to eating! Enter Mr. Fred. Greenhough.</span></p>

Now, just outside of town to me meant just that; like in Jasper Place, or Beverly, not some 65 or so miles out of town into the boonies! Mr. Greenhough asked if I knew how to feed pigs; I told him I knew which end to put the food, and that apparently secured me a job and I was off. Not telling the rest of the family where I was going; I assumed the farm being &#39;just outside of town&#39; I would be back for tea, or something like that! They did eventually find me, visiting me some six weeks later! Before leaving Edmonton I spent most of the last $20.00 to buy a winter coat.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Mr. Fred Greenhough was a bit of enigma to me! I could not quite make him out!! It was therefore good to read a little of his history . Fred was born in 1896, in Burnley, Lancs. UK. second child of James and Mary Jane Greenhough. The family arrived in the Genesee area in 1903. Although not too much of Fred&#39;s early childhood is mentioned, notes of log cabins, harsh winters, mud, snow and other weather vagaries, indicated it was not all roses! Fred served in the First World War.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Community service was a great part of Mr. Greenhough&#39;s life, although I was unaware of it. He served on various boards including the Teldfordville Pastoral Charge, the Genesee School Board, Breton General Hospital, and the Duffield Rural Electrification Association. He must also have been an astute businessman running a successful farm and equipment operation.</span></p>

Glen mentioned a figure with 2000 in it, regarding acres! All the homes and buildings looked huge. I was duly impressed. But I must add that when I went back to England for a visit some 5 or 6 years later I found England had shrunk and the roads and houses seemed small! Fifty years later and the 7 years spent in Leduc County, the spread did not seem so big, not small, but just normal for the County (and me).</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The Greenhough family showed me considerable kindness and tolerance during my first six months in Canada. When I arrived at the settlement, living in a bungalow, was the matriarch of the family: Mary Jane, (1870-1968) widow of James, (1866-1941). The first home to be reached on the farm housed Fred (1896-1972) his wife Stella (1891-1982) and their son Glen. Daughter Mary was married and lived in St. Francis. Next door lived Hargreaves (1902-1968) with his wife Marjorie (1902-1974). Above the International Harvester shop lived Hargreave&#39;s son, Harvey (1926-1998) and Olga and their children, with at least one son, Gerald (1957-1987). Building a bungalow on the land was another son, Bill and his wife, Lydia (1929-2004). There was another son, Donnie, who was not around too often, as I think he was a truck driver.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">From what I could gather Mary Jane and James had arrived around 1903, had settled north of the river, in a wooden building with a dirt floor. The story has it the husband wanted to return to the UK but his wife wanted to stick it out!</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">After the deaths of Fred and Hargreaves, Harvey, Glen, Bill and their wives continued the family grain/hog farming operation until Harvey passed away suddenly on May 23, 1998, at the age of seventy-one years. With changing circumstances and conditions, Glenn and Bill decided to discontinue raising hogs in the spring of 1999. The Greenhoughs had produced hogs on the farm over seventy years.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">I re-introduced myself to Bill and Harvey (apparently) just before Harvey died. I was working as a contractor with Leduc County and a call had left me pretty close to the Greenhoughs. What struck me immediately was that nothing seemed as large has it had when I had left the farm in 1957! I guess I had become Canadian! Both Bill and Harvey greeted me warmly, obviously having forgotten my tenure as a hired man!</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><font color="blue">[The article that follows is by Glen Greenhough as recorded in <i>Golden Memories</i>, pages 41-42. Book can by found at the Warburg United Church]</font></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">&nbsp;In the early years prior to 1906, crossing the river was done by row boat, raft or fording during low water, and on the ice during the winter months. One ford used by the Indians was about two miles down-stream from the Charlie Cropley ferry crossing.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="28" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">B<span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><img align="left" alt="Glen Greenhough" height="136" hspace="20" pbzloc="29" src="jtfarm14.jpg" style="height: 253px; width: 181px" vspace="20" width="105" /></span>y 1906 it was necessary to be able to cross the river at higher levels of water with teams of horses and wagons and the like, so for that purpose Charlie Cropley built a scow large enough which was rowed or poled across by several men. In 1910 the Scheideman family built and operated a cable ferry about four miles north-east of the Cropley crossing, landing on the south half of 5-30-51-W5, on the Genesee side of the river.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">In 1910 or 1911 Charley Cropley built a cable ferry. During the summer of 1913 an incident occurred during high water in which the cable broke freeing the ferry to drift down stream for several miles before the men on board could beach it. This time it was brought back upstream by a team of horses and put back into service. At this time the Alberta Government supplied a cable and Cropley continued to operate the ferry until the record high water in 1915 again caused the cable to break, thus freeing the ferry which was last seen drifting with the current. It was seen passing through Edmonton six hours later. After this calamity, the Alberta Government took over the entire project. Hugo Nieman, the first government operator, ran the ferry until 1920 when James Greenhough took over the job which he held until hi retirement in 1936. In the years following, a number of different men held the position of ferry man.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Many times during its years of operation after 1915 the ferry fell victim to the many hazards the river had to offer. To mention just a few: in 1928 it was overcome by driftwood during rising water and when the crest had passed was left sitting several feet above the water on to of a drift pile; after the second highest water level in 1944 the ferry <img align="left" alt="The ferry with the combine" height="206" hspace="20" src="jtfarm15.jpg" vspace="20" width="300" />was left high and dry far out of the water; in 1946 a sudden cold spell in the fall caused an ice jam resulting in much strain being put on the main cable, and the danger of toppling the towers was relieved only by cutting the lead cables with a cutting torch.<font color="blue">[The photo shows the combine bought by the Greenhoughs and the first in Western Canada, photo courtesy of Glen Greenhough]</font></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">In 1947 due to high water and mechanical failure of the hand winch the ferry turned broadside in midstream breaking the anchor bolt of the main cable and letting the ferry float several hundred feet down stream. The people on board this time were forced to leave by swimming or by lifeboat.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Even though it was a risky, hazardous job, no one ever suffered serious injury while working around or crossing on the ferry. In the late 1940&#39;s a second cable was added down stream on the ferry to aid in crossing during high up-stream winds. In 1953, to cope with ever increasing volume of traffic, a second man was added to help, and in 1955 a motor was placed on the ferry to further speed up crossing.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The Genesee ferry operated until the fall of 1966 when it was replaced by the new Genesee bridge.</span></p>

I was taken to the pig barn where the pigs scheduled for market were housed. The mixing of the food took place in a cart; I suppose 18 inches by 36 inches, on wheels. The food was poured from a sack into the container and water added: stirred with a small spade. Glen could not produce an exact recipe: I had to watch the stools of the pigs and if they were too liquid then something had to be reduced or was that increased? Fifty years gone by does not aid the memory! The cart was wheeled so that the mixture could be placed so as to feed the pigs. Fred talked of designing a feeding system where dry feed would be used; two angle iron bars would be welded together; secured at either end to a mechanism that would rotate and allow feed to fall into the trough.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="4" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">I distinctly remember how hard it was for me to mix that stuff; I was just out of the army and had not really engaged in much physical activity. But, after a week or so, I could mix with the best. After feeding the pigs housed in the barn, buckets of feed had to be taken to the farrowing barn and then to the sows and boar outside.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">After feeding came &#39;mucking out&#39;; (I had been told by Glen that pigs were not the dirty animals that they were portrayed to be, as they knew where to sleep and where to do important body functions!) Cleaning was accomplished by using the overhead &#39;railway&#39;; a fairly large container on a track circled the interior of the barn, then out to the dumping grounds. In a moment of madness, and surely connected to my army days, I squared off the piles of manure; those who farm with pigs would realize:Well never mind!</span></p>

It was not a modern house! No running water but there was electricity. On the main floor there were three rooms, and upstairs, perhaps one. The kitchen was the first room you entered: the stove was the first thing noted. There where no washroom facilities. The comfort station was outside; correct toilet paper was quickly installed. In England I had lived in a three-bed roomed home, built in 1937. It had running water, electricity, was heated and had a full washroom with a bath. I figured I had moved backwards by some 100 hundred years. But press on! Immigrants cannot be choosers.</span></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">I&#39;m not sure if my boss really understood what I was experiencing:in one conversation he said (I was never quite sure when Fred was kidding or not!) he had met English people who believed milk came from cans. What udder (!) nonsense. I don&#39;t think he could appreciate that I had come from a village where I was five minutes from the stores (shops), with paved roads, mail came every day, every home had running water et al. I have to say, though, without reservation, that the whole family treated me very kindly.</span></span></p>

I had no electrical appliances. The stove was replaced with one from Eaton&#39;s; but it was not used often as our farming days were about over.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><b>Groceries</b></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">In order to get Groceries or letters mailed I would leave a list and the letters in a slot in the office; I could not understand why I did not get the groceries right away: it was not until later I learned the nearest grocery store was about a mile away; daily visits were not the norm. It&#39;s not that I was ungrateful, it was simply I was not a Canadian and most definitely not a rural Canadian! I remember one trip to Edmonton where I stocked up on groceries, at Avenue Trading on 118 Avenue. I had a steady diet of tinned meat (spam?) golden wax beans and prune plums, items never on my menu now.</span></p>

Harvey Greenhough asked if I would like to go to a movie? Would I like to go to a movie!!!! I dressed as if I were in England, (hey, no one told me what to wear!) suit, tie, and shiny shoes. Thorsby in 1957 had no paved streets or sidewalks. Ah well, it gave the locals a bit of a laugh! Don&#39;t remember the film.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Tried popcorn for the first time, not impressed, have a better opinion of it now! After the show I was taken to a caf&eacute;, I must have stood out like a sore thumb. After coffee Donnie Greenhough, and some friends took me for a ride to see an oil well. I distinctly remember the speedometer of the car, the Buick, reading 90 mph as we drove over dirt roads. I viewed my first oil derrick at 2.00 a.m. I was glad to get home.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><b>Over populated?</b></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">It was on the way to the movies that Harvey, who was driving the truck, remarked how over-crowded the area was growing. I was amazed, it seemed I did not see a house forever. If I had known then about such things as quarter sections I would have understood. However, even in 2009 that part of the County could not be described as over populated</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">From their treatment of me it was obvious that the Fred Greenhoughs were Christians (at least we had that in common). They had invited me to a prayer meeting held in their home, grace was said before every meal. I attended church, which was held in the Genesee School. A Rev. Hutchinson was the minister; he was a circuit preacher with churches at Genesee, Warburg and Telfordville and Breton. Warburg United Church.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><img align="left" alt="Warburg United Church" height="154" hspace="20" pbzloc="7" src="jtfarm23.jpg" style="height: 237px; width: 339px" vspace="20" width="250" /> <b>Warburg United Church</b> On Good Friday 1957 I attended the inaugural service of the new or reconstructed Warburg United Church, shown in the picture to the left. . The minister was still nailing the cross to the wall as I entered: Very meaningful for that time of the year to those who believe.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">&nbsp;I also attended the (re)-opening of the Rundle Mission at Pigeon Lake. The Buick became stuck in the mud and I learned the &#39;sit on the hood&#39; method as opposed to the &#39;push from behind&#39; process. The &#39;it on the hood&#39; seemed to succeed.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><font color="blue">[The photo of Rundle Mission proved by Colleen Lomas, manager of the Mission.]</font></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><b>Strange custom: To us!</b></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">In England you have to be properly introduced before one dines with a stranger, I learned it is not so in Genesee! I had ordered a bag of potatoes; they were duly delivered around noon. The man put the potatoes down but lingered unduly at the door, and he lingered even longer, so long in fact that it struck me as very strange! He did eventually leave, I mentioned it to Fred; he said the man was waiting to be invited in for lunch, it was his pattern. Strange but true!</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><b>Tractors</b></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">A garden surrounded Fred&#39;s home on three sides; Fred was tilling the soil using a tractor , his wife said he looked like a monkey on a peanut. As a guest I was not sure whether to laugh or remain silent, I chose the latter even if the remark seemed appropriate. It was a very small tractor!</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Speaking of tractors : I drove the same small tractor around the yard. I enhanced my &#39;backing up with a trailer&#39; skills. On one occasion I tried to change gears going up a hill just outside the Greenhough enclave. The front wheels came up in an alarming manner. I had visions of being a crushed peanut under a tractor! Again, although I never actually operated the auger to move wheat, I was warned of the dangers of this piece of equipment close to loose clothing, particularly if you positioned yourself so that the groin area was too close. There was at least one dramatic story that may or may not have been true! It was with some surprise that I learned many years later Harvey had been injured using the machinery.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><b pbzloc="13">Sounds of Music</b></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><img align="right" alt="Old-time radio" height="133" hspace="20" pbzloc="12" src="jtfarm24.jpg" style="height: 200px; width: 236px" vspace="20" width="150" /> I had left my relatives at the immigration hall without telling them where I was going. It was six weeks before I saw them again. They brought a small radio with them, without a tuning dial. It was stuck on 6.30 CHED, which was a music(?) channel. I learned stereo sound was being introduced: To get the affect of this new invention one needed two radios, which if played simultaneously, on the same station, of course, they would produce stereophonic sound. I was unable to carry out this experiment. I only had one radio! Some tunes coming to mind for that period are, &#39;A White Coat and a Pink Carnation&#39;, &#39;A Slow Boat to China&#39;, &#39;The Shrimps Boats are Coming&#39; and &#39;So Rare&#39;.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><b>Farrowing</b></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Another first at Genesee was actually seeing a sow (or any other animal or human) give birth to piglets. The piglets were thrust from the sow at what seemed great force and with repeated regularity. The sow seemed most disinterested in the whole proceedings. Glen had warned me, about sows with a litter so I took no chances when I later entered the sty.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><b>Veterinarians? Methinks not!</b></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Glen had noticed a sow wandering loose with the others in the yard; it had an infected side. The plan was to corral the sow; cut the swelling in order to release what we guessed was be pus inside. Our herding efforts went un-rewarded but in the process the sow must have knocked against something; the wound opened and was on its way to being cleansed. We kept a careful eye on the sow for some time to ensure the healing process took place. Glen and I were relieved at the self-induced treatment.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><b>Dreaming</b></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">It took next to no time to realize I was not intended for farming life. (I&#39;m sure the Greenhoughs must have realized this as well although they continued to treat me well). So July 1957 saw me headed for the big City. The stove I had purchased arrived sometime later and was sold to a person to use in their cottage.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><b>The Big City</b></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">This story is not about Edmonton; suffice it to say the good Lord was kind to me. I first worked in a warehouse, then moved to the City Police (remember Stallknecht, Maday and Hobbs) After 18 years in the Police I moved to the first of several management positions before retiring in 1994. Genesee was far from my mind. But then I finished up at a Noxious Weed Seminar in Genesee, there I met one of the Greenhough daughter&#39;s, I hired an Australian fellow who had worked for a Greenhough.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><b>Assistant Development Officer</b></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">My youngest daughter, a legal secretary, heard a bylaw enforcement officer was needed in Fort Saskatchewan; this turned out to be that an assistant development officer was wanted in the then County of Leduc! I was hired and had to find my way around with a map that only gave legal descriptions. I always took my lunch when I went on my visits! Being hired was very much like when Mr. Fred Greenhough first hired me. I knew a fair bit about (some) bylaws and had supervised people in bylaw enforcement. It is a real test of your skills when you have to actually carry out investigations, based on what you had taught others to do!</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><b>The Power Plant</b></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><img align="right" alt="Genesee Power Plant" height="101" hspace="20" pbzloc="9" src="jtfarm25.jpg" style="height: 167px; width: 238px" vspace="20" width="125" /> I won&#39;t mention the names of the people I worked with and for in the County, but I will say, unreservedly, they treated me with great respect (age will do that!). They told me about short cuts, what to watch for when entering a farmyard (dogs) and that Leduc people are fine to deal with and, for the most part this turned out to be true.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">With my hiring, a new era was beginning. There had been development officers prior to me; however, much of the enforcement work had been done by &#39;word of mouth&#39;. My city training had taught me there needed to be a written accounting of visits and responses from the citizens. I do believe I achieved a modicum of success. Folks in the County are no different than city folk when it comes to following the rules, 90% or higher simply do as they are asked. Of the remaining 10% about 7.5% do conform with some harder work. The remainder is best not mentioned.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Genesee did not cause me any undue concerns: The only Genesee files I recall were the power plant and St. John&#39;s School which were dealt with through telephone calls. After 7 years I retired (again) and left on good terms with the staff and most of the people I had dealt with.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><font color="blue">[One file I dealt with related to the Power Plant, George Greenhough had something to with the landscaping!]</font></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">I have been dealt fairly by the folks in the County and more so by the Greenhoughs! Genesee will always bring fond memories.</span></p>
