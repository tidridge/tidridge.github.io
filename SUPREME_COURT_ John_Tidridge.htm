The peace officer thereafter wrote out an appearance notice for impaired driving and refusing to provide a breath sample into the road-side testing device, and the appellant was permitted to leave with a companion who drove his motor vehicle.</font></font></font></font></p>

The vehicle straightened out; and then Sergeant Tidridge paid particular attention to it as it travelled east on 114<sup>th</sup> Avenue. It was seen that the vehicle had a distinct weave inasmuch as it moved from side to side a complete vehicle width. It took approximately a 100 feet to accomplish this weave; and as it did so, it moved completely to the left of the unmarked center line and then to the right, almost striking cars parked at the south curb, 114<sup>th</sup> Avenue. Sergeant Tidridge applied the interior red light of the police vehicle, and noted that, although the vehicle reacted almost immediately, it took a long time to finally come to a halt, spending some time edging along the curb before finally coming to this stop.</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

On closer checking, Sergeant Tidridge noted his breath smelled strongly of an intoxicating liquor; beer, as a matter of fact. He was asked whether he was drinking: He denied it; produced his documents plus one credit card; did this without too much difficulty. He was not exactly sure of where he was, but he was not lost. He was driving a friend home.</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

Walking was fair: Asked him to walk ten paces; some slight sway from normal. Turning wasn&#39;t done. Finger to nose touch, finger to nose test: he did quite well. The tests were carried out on a dry, paved road surface. His attitude was co-operative. Speech was noted to be slurred.</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

He appeared to understand but was continually asking questions. Sergeant Tidridge explained the best he could. He, in essence, refused, saying he wanted his lawyer present on the street before he did any tests. Sergeant Tidridge wrote out an appearance notice for impaired driving and requested that the accused sign the same and indicated that it was an offence not to do so, and that he was merely signing a receipt of receiving an appearance notice. He declined to sign the appearance notice; as a result, Sergeant Tidridge just gave him the appearance notice without having it signed. And in view of the fact that there was a companion of the accused that was sober, he was allowed to go.</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

In the case of Brownridge he had been arrested and was being held in the police cells at the time when his request to instruct counsel was refused, whereas in the present case the appellant, having complied with the peace officer&#39;s &quot;sobriety tests&quot; was allowed to go away and was not thereafter detained. The difference between the two cases constitutes a striking example of the following proposition stated by Freedman J.A., as he then was, in R. v.

This, however, is not such a case; in my view no debatable question arises.</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></blockquote>

In the result the sample was given upon the constable advising the accused that he had no right to see anybody before giving it. Under these circumstances, the evidence of the result of the breath test was admitted at trial.</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

Such a person is under a duty to submit to the test. If he goes away, or attempts to go away, to avoid the test, he may be arrested and charged but this does not mean that he is under arrest until this happens. He is merely obeying directions that police officers are entitled to issue. Motorists cannot reasonably expect to be allowed to seek legal advice before complying with such orders. Police officers are fully justified in treating as a definitive refusal a refusal to comply until legal advice is obtained.</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></blockquote>

Such is not, it appears to me, the legal situation of one who has been required &quot;to accompany&quot; a peace officer for the purpose of having a breath test taken. The test may well be negative and, in such a case, it would be quite wrong to say that this person was arrested or detained and then released. Detained means held in custody as is apparent from such provision as s. 15 of the Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.I-2.</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></blockquote>
