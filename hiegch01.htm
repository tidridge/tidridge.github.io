<p align="right">March 12, 1954</p>
Mr. E. Hyde, Principal, 
<br>Eastglen Composite High School, 
<br>11430 - 68<sup>th</sup> Street, 
<br>Edmonton, Alberta. 
<p>Dear Mr. Hyde:</p> 
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">As of Monday, March 15th Eastwood High changes its name to Eastglen Composite High School, and will take up residence in the new partially complete building. Allow us to extend congratulations to you on continuing your duties as Principal of the new school.</p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">I write this letter to bring to your attention several matters connected with the occupancy of the new building.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">Firstly in the Board's action in appointing Mr. Maurice Munro to the position of Head Caretaker in the new building I feel that you will find Mr. Munro a very capable, co-operative and efficient caretaker. I would ask you to realize however, that during the next several months the school will be operating and our Contractors also completing various parts of the building, and that this condition will undoubtedly present many difficulties and cause inconvenience at times. Mr. Munro as our custodian will have many problems with which to contend, and will require your assistance and advice at times to cope with these situations.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">The Eastglen Composite High School building is probably the most modern High School in the West. Features embodied in its design were carefully considered, and the general layout lent itself to ease of administration and teaching. Operation of all the features embodied for comfort and convenience will possibly not be complete until the summer holidays, but will most certainly be available in September on the re-opening of school. The heating plant will I think remain under control of the Contractor pending completion and acceptance, but I do not think any difficulties will be encountered. Should problems dealing with operation of the plant arise I would ask that you take them up through my office rather than deal directly with the Contractor.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">There will be many parts of the building from which students must be excluded at the present time. Our Contractor has asked our co-operation in this connection. I  would suggest that you instruct your staff and students to the effect that no trespassing into unfinished portions of the building be made. The mere fact that the Contractor is continuing operations while the school is operating in the building will present enough problems. I am sure you will appreciate this situation and give your full co-operation.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">I would suggest that your students be fully acquainted with their responsibility in occupying this fine building and  that they make every effort to keep it in good condition.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">I would appreciate hearing from you as to telephone requirements in order  that we may take step to have installations made. I believe that  in addition to the telephone in the General Office you will require one in the Guidance Councillor's Office and also one in the staff common room. Mr. Munro will be given a telephone when his office is completed. I doubt very much whether the Board will consider any further installation at this time.</p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">For your information the street address of Eastglen Composite High School for mailing purposes,  etc. is 11430-68 Street.</p>
Distribution of keys to the staff for Classrooms, etc. will commence next week, or as soon as we are able to cut the required duplicates, In this connection please bear with us as the keying set up on such a plant presents many problems. 
Please do not hesitate  to call me in connection with any problems you might have dealing with the operation of the school in so far as they concern my Department.</p> 
<p align="center">Very truly yours, 
<br>W.W. Butchart M.R.A.I.C.
<br>Architect-Supt. of Plant </p><hr>
<img src="hiegl13.jpg" width=250 height=329 vspace=5 hspace=5 align=left alt="Cover of 1953-54 School Year Book">
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">The emblem to the left is taken from the cover of the year book for 1953-54 for Eastglen High School Obviously the school opened with a flourish, with all the appropriate dignitaries sending congratulations. The school was touted as the best in the west and great things were expected. The Minutes that are found further down this document give a line by account of much of the building process.</p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">Eastglen was privileged to have all 4 of John Tidridge's children attend the school and 7 of his grandchildren. He hopes the school was better for it! Two of his granddaughters found their future spouses among the other students. Well done Eastglen. His own visits to the school have been restricted to concerts, basketball games  and a trip to the office to deliver material. At that time he was impressed with the size of the students...

<p>As you read, if you do that is, you will notice that the School Board seems to deal with insignificant sums of money. To put this is in perspective I have included teachers' salaries for certain years. The first block has been developed by Glen David Dickie, a professional engineer, husband to Stephanie Tyler, both are former Eastglen students. David bases his results on facts offered by Paula Coliton of the Alberta Teachers' Association. David explained he tried to include as much research as was available to come him to arrive at these figures.</p>
