			</center>

			<blockquote>
			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Hampshire is the home of the Titheridges, so it seems appropriate to know something of this county of origin, especially for our fellow genealogists who live abroad.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Hampshire is a county of south central England. It has been populated since early times and there is evidence of prehistoric settlements of most ages present. Winchester is the focal point of the road system built by the Romans. The county is first mentioned in the Anglo Saxon Chronicle in 755 AD when Winchester was an important town.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">The county has always been agricultural, the main concerns being dairy farming,production of corn and market gardening. There is still a large acreage of woodland. Portsmouth and Gosport form one of Britain&#39;s principal naval centres and Southampton is a major passenger port. Tourism is also important, while market towns also have light industries such as engineering. </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Visits to the villages reveal the agricultural nature of the area. The villages are beautiful and many of the villages give the impression of stepping back in time. They are full of old cottages, some still with old thatched roofs. In all villages, the old village church forms a distinctive landmark centre piece of the village.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">A few of the smaller villages are little more than a handful of cottages built near the large manor house and church. It seems natural that our agricultural forbearers would work the land for the wealthy landowners who lived at the manor houses, moving from village to village as necessary to find work.</font></p>
