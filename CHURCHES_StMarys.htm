			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">St. Mary&#39;s Anglican Church is part of a worldwide family of churches of approximately 80 million members who are held together by our customs and traditions (Common Prayer and the historic creeds of the church), and a characteristic way of doing theology.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Anglican worship is biblical. Our prayer books are full of scripture, and at each service we read and reflect on God&#39;s word in many forms. Over the course of a 3 year period the majority of the Bible is read aloud during worship.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Anglican worship is sacramental. We believe that God&#39;s grace is expressed to us through material things - through water, wine and bread, through anointing with oil. The Eucharist, celebrated week by week, is at the heart of the Church&#39;s worship, giving us food for our journey bringing us into communion with God and with each other. Baptism and other sacraments mark important moments in our life.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Anglican worship involves all our senses. Our services use colour, music, symbols, art, poetic language, sometimes the smell of flowers or incense, the taste of bread and wine, touching hands at the passing of the Peace, changing postures as we sit, kneel or stand.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Anglican worship involves both clergy and lay people. We offer many opportunities for lay people of all ages to participate in worship. Anglican worship is a community activity.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">As a male, I was not at all sure of what to expect when I arrived for my appointment with the new (female) minister at St. Mary&#39;s Anglican Church! My &#39;fears&#39; were quickly allayed and in no time at all I was enjoying a cup of freshly brewed coffee with Rev. Elizabeth Metcalfe.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Although Elizabeth is &quot;new&quot; she has been at St. Mary&#39;s for a while now, starting out as an interim minister replacing Rev. Thomas Bauer she is now officially appointed in the position.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">How does a mother of five, a former rancher, medical technologist, community worker finish up as a minister? Elizabeth described it as &#39;doors being opened by God, that she has chosen to walk through, strengthened by a long desire to help people&#39;. Before entering the ministry several people, in several locations and with no connections with each other, had said &quot;Surely you belong in fulltime ministry&quot;! Elizabeth admits it took awhile for the idea to gel and too come to fruition.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><span pbzloc="146" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">After completing her Divinity degree at Newman Seminary (yes, it is!) Elizabeth served in Spruce Grove, Morinville and St. Albert. Her sense of humour not too far away Elizabeth recalled a time when she was seated in a coffee shop (another habit?), and one of a group of farmers asked what she was (a Nun perhaps?) and what she should be called..... after telling them what she was, she said what they called her was up to them but to remember never to call her too late for supper.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Responding to questions about dog (clerical) collars, a friend of her daughter&#39;s suggested perhaps a new fashion trend, ... Questions were answered without a tightening of the jaw or a steely eyed look! Obviously very comfortable in her &#39;skin&#39;!</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><span pbzloc="145" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">She spoke enthusiastically about relationships as a means of people connecting with God&#39;s love and the place of groups in the church, and groups that are formed through activities such as the Alpha course and youth groups.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Her vision and hope was that the church would become better known as a place in the community where people could come and be welcomed to find hope, refreshment and experience more of God&#39;s presence.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Even if the Rev. Thomas Brauer is only half as accommodating to his congregants as he was me when I interviewed him recently, they are indeed a fortunate congregation. What struck me immediately, well as soon as he stood up, was his height. .. he towered over me by a couple of inches or more and I&#39;m 6&#39;3&quot;!! So much for my thoughts of<br />
			having a &#39;power&#39; interview where my size would make him feel threatened!</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The Reverend is from Sault Ste. Marie, via Toronto. As a younger man he had a powerful conversion experience, the telling of which was not for this interview! Formerly a rock and roll lighting technician, Father Brauer is now<br />
			in his first parish. Married to Cheryl, he is looking forward to his ministry in this area. He has a desire to &#39;get out&#39; into the community and make the Christian message known. I found him to have a good sense of humour, a good listener and he has a non-threatening attitude in spite of his height and his &#39;dog&#39; collar. (It&#39;s OK, I got his permission to call it that and we were able to share Church of England and Anglican experiences) I sensed him to be a compassionate man but one who would also tell it like it is.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: left"><span pbzloc="143" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">I was not sure what I was expecting from the interview but I left it feeling that St. Mary&#39;s is in good (human) hands. Welcome to the neighbourhood!!</span></p>

			<p><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">The History of St. Mary&#39;s Anglican, The Highlands 1913-1994</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">St. Mary&#39;s Anglican Church, commenced as a Sunday school for the children of Anglican families in the Highlands area of Edmonton. In February of 1913, an Anglican deaconess, out from England, began her missionary work in a log house situated on 74 street and Jasper Avenue. Sadly, this building was struck by lightning and burned to the ground August of that year. The furnishings from this early building were, however, saved and the congregation moved to a frame building in the same area, the area of the Standard Coal Mine in the Virginia Park area.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Mrs. Lloyd, Superintendent of the Sunday school at that time, brought her children to her own home for the Sunday school classes. This house, still in good repair, stands at 11209-66 street (then called Wentworth Street). It is noteworthy by the curved arches on its second floor balcony. </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">The Rev. Norman Ashby was St. Mary&#39;s first Priest-in-Charge. He came from England as did all St. Mary&#39;s early rectors. In the early years, all Anglican parishes were subsidized by the Mother Church of England and all early Anglican clergymen in Canada came from the Motherland. The Rev. Ashby was with St. Mary&#39;s from its inception July, 1913 until October, 1914.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Through the generosity of a Rev. Mr. Sale, three thirty-three foot lots were purchased at the present site of St. Mary&#39;s. Construction began June, 1914, of a 20&#39; by 30&#39; building. Upon completion, this church was dedicated to the Glory of God by Bishop Harry Allan Grey, the first Bishop of the newly-formed Diocese of Edmonton. Early records and pictures show that the Sunday school flourished greatly from that time on.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Between the years, 1918-20, St. Mary&#39;s shared its minister with St. Michael&#39;s Anglican Church in North Edmonton. He was the Reverend F. D. Mercer who had been Chaplain of the Church of England to the Embassy in Japan prior to coming to Canada.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">1922-26 saw the Rev. Mr. Swann at St. Mary&#39;s. During his incumbency many changes were made in the church building itself. It was raised to allow a brick-walled basement to be built beneath it. The chancel and sanctuary were added. During part of this time, parishioners received notice that &quot;No further services in the church building were possible due to the intense cold in the building because of the church extension&quot;.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">During these early years and, too, into the 1940&#39;s, Judge Bury acted in many capacities in St. Mary&#39;s: church warden, lay reader, organist, vestryman and preacher. While organist, Judge Bury is quoted as saying: &quot;It is doubtful the heater was ever lighted; even at morning service, the frost covered keys of the organ &#39;Burned&#39; the organist&#39;s fingers.&quot; Electric lighting was installed and the west end of the church building was extended, allowing 105 seats.</font></p>

			<p style="text-indent: 35px; text: justify"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">The Rev. H.H. Stickings served as St. Mary&#39;s rector from 1926-28. The Rev. Leversedge followed. Later Mr. Leversedge was named &#39;Cannon&#39; and later still &#39;Archdeacon&#39;.</font></p>

			<p style="text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">From 1938-40 the Rev. Mr. Story was St. Mary&#39;s rector, until he left for active service in World War II. Much was accomplished during his short stay at St. Mary&#39;s. The bell tower was added, church windows were installed and the choir stalls were added. During those early years in Edmonton, present day 112 avenue was called Knox Avenue, 68 st was know as Wadleigh Street.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">In 1943 a promising and influential Men&#39;s Club was formed at St. Mary&#39;s under the impressive leadership of the late Leonard Suss. This Men&#39;s club undertook the superintendency of the Sunday school and one of its members, Wilbur Scott, held that position for many years. The men&#39;s Club took under their wing parish service men, home following the war, until each one was once again established into civilian life.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">The Men&#39;s Club landscaped and cared for the church grounds, after which many old timers still recall the delightful garden parties held during the summer months. The Men&#39;s Club was influential in replacing the individual chairs in the church nave with conventional pews. These they acquired from the masons who had purchased a former church for their lodge. St. Mary&#39;s and St. Mark&#39;s parishes shared the Rev. Arthur Elliott as their rector until 1946.</font></p>

			<p style="text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">June, 1944, saw St. Mary&#39;s first ordination when Jack L. Anderson was ordained to the diaconate. Noteworthy too, is the fact that Jack was the first Edmontonian to take Holy Orders in the Anglican Church. Through these years, the Church Building sat on the site of the present Chapel. </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">In 1946, the Reverend W.W. (Bill) Elkin became rector of St. Mary&#39;s and would remain thus until 1958, the longest incumbency to that date. Many, many changes took place during Bill&#39;s tenure. The church was moved from its original site to its present location, now known as the &quot;upper hall&quot;. The so-called Sunday school building was constructed on the former church site. This building now houses the chapel and the nursery.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">In 1949, the rectory was built for Bill, Kay and their family. Prior to that the Elkins made their home in a house in the 111 block of 62 st. (little house next to the alley on the east side of 62<sup>nd</sup> st. Vestry notes that for the house, a rent of $60. per month was paid. </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Plans were drawn up by Ken Alton for the building plans and construction of the present St. Mary&#39;s Church. A proud day it was indeed when the entire congregation met outdoors following the morning service the May of 1953, to watch Bishop Barfoot turn the first sod from which would rise the new St. Mary&#39;s. The two wardens, attendant at the sod-turning ceremony that day still (since passed away) remain parishioners of St. Mary&#39;s: Bob White and Eric Marsh. What a happy day it was for the family of St. Mary&#39;s when on January 23, 1954, Bishop-elect Clarke, Dean of Ottawa, dedicated the new St. Mary&#39;s Church to the glory of God. Dean Clarke became Bishop of Edmonton Diocese the following Day.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">During the early years, St. Mary&#39;s Junior Auxiliary (the J.A.) flourished as many young girls in its ranks took many awards on the Diocesan level, revealing the very fine training by their dedicated leaders. The 40<sup>th</sup> Edmonton Scout Troop, met at St. Mary&#39;s weekly under the able direction of Scout master Lawrence Twigge, and others. During those years, ten Boy Scouts from the 40<sup>th</sup> became Queen Scouts. </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">When the Rev. Bill Elkin left St. Mary&#39;s, Archdeacon G.W. Wilson became St. Mary&#39;s rector. And so, through the following years, under the leadership of Canon Brian Brown (1964-1973), the Rev. Fabian W. Hugh (1973-1979), Dr. Ed Schmitt (1979-1982, the Rev. Alex Thomas (1982-1987), St Mary&#39;s then enjoyed having as its priest-in-charge Canon George E. Morris until his death.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">It was during the time of Rev. George Morris that Wayne Masliuk was ordained Vocational Deacon by Bishop Victoria Matthews. After Father George&#39;s retirement, the parish was served by an Interim ministry team (Wendy Ainsworth - later ordained and Rev. Donald Grey). Rev. Thomas Brauer was rector from 2007 to 2009 when Rev. Elizabeth Metcalfe was appointed Interim Priest. She was appointed Rector effective Sept. 1, 2009. Thus, St. Mary&#39;s Anglican Church, the Highlands, has developed for nearly 100 years as a vibrant church on the move, producing regular outreach to those beyond its doors, as well as administering to its own congregation&#39;s spiritual and social needs.</font></p>
