			<p pbzloc="61">To:&nbsp; The&nbsp;Friends of Highlands:</p>

			<p>This email is to let you know what we have been working on regarding the Highlands Neighborhood renewal since you completed our survey a couple of months ago. &nbsp;Based on the outcome of that survey, it&rsquo;s clear that many of you do not believe the consultation was either effective or representative of your views.<br />
			<br />
			The survey respondents&nbsp;<strong>overwhelmingly agreed (95 %) that further consultation was required</strong>. An overwhelming majority of&nbsp;<strong>survey respondents that answered the question (100%) were opposed to the proposed extending and squaring off of the corner</strong>s as proposed by the City in their design. Residents believe that this action will forever damage the unique and historical identity of the community.<br />
			<br />
			The survey had 195 views and 116 responses for&nbsp;<strong>a 60% participation rate</strong>&nbsp;which is an excellent response rate and shows how important this issue is to the residents. There are a few themes in these survey results we want to point out. Specifically:<br />
			<br />
			<strong>1. Everyone wants a safe and accessible neighborhood&nbsp;</strong><br />
			<strong><strong>2. The iconic rounded corners in the area south of 112 Avenue are the most important part of the Highlands Community&rsquo;s connection to its identity.&nbsp;</strong><br />
			<strong>3. There was a disconnect in the consultation process from what the residents told the City versus what they heard. The community wants to work with the City to address the current City design to reflect what is important to the community.&nbsp;</strong><br />
			<strong>4. Heritage and identity of a Community should not be damaged during the process of neighbourhood renewal.&nbsp;</strong><br />
			<strong>5. A one size fits all approach to neighborhood renewal does not work in all neighborhoods.&nbsp;</strong><br />
			<strong>6. The cost of changes versus the perceived benefits are not warranted at this time of fiscal austerity.&nbsp;</strong><br />
			<strong>7. An overwhelming majority of respondents do not want to see the narrowing of Ada Boulevard</strong></strong>. &nbsp;<br />
			<br />
			The summarized survey results were used to support our community advocacy and input into developing an alternative design to ensure Ada Boulevard has a pedestrian priority first and, most importantly, looking for alternatives to squaring the rounded corners (cost savings and identity). The Friends of Highlands has retained professional planning and engineering support from B&amp;A Planning Group and Bunt &amp; Associates to help focus our vision and facilitate a healthy and productive dialogue with City Administration to present an alternative evidence-based approach. We are&nbsp;<strong>planning to present our alternative neighbourhood design for the area of 111 Avenue and Ada Boulevard</strong>&nbsp;to Councillor Caterina in the next few weeks prior to bringing it forward to City Administration for consideration.</p>

			<p><br />
			We believe what we are asking is reasonable and supportable, and <strong>we only focused on certain aspects of the design that our Consulting team felt would give us the best opportunity to make a case for change</strong>. There is no guarantee that the City will consider any proposed changes at this stage but we would be remiss if we did not try. The primary areas of focus are the iconic corners from 64 to 56<sup>th</sup> street on 111 Ave and Ada Boulevard, and Ada Boulevard from 67<sup>th</sup> street to 50th street. &nbsp;The added connector sidewalks and raised cross walks were not addressed as part of the scope of this project given the City&#39;s priority on accessibility in neighborhood renewals. &nbsp;It was also recommended by our Consultant to keep the button at 60th street and 111 avenue as it will keep the rounded corners at this intersection. &nbsp; As always, the devil is in the detail and&nbsp;the City indicated at our last meeting with them that during the detailed design phase prior to construction there would be an opportunity to further discuss the raised cross walks, parking impacts and landscape plan. &nbsp;The City also indicated that impacted property owners will be met with individually prior to construction.<br />
			<br />
			With this project, we are hoping to&nbsp;<strong>clearly communicate one succinct alternative approach for the City to consider&nbsp;</strong>that not only meets the City&rsquo;s operational and safety needs but also assists in reducing the capital costs of this project in light of the current fiscal crisis while also retaining the most important aspects of the community&rsquo;s identity &ndash; its grand rounded corners and broad tree-lined streets. Part of this alternative approach, while largely supporting the City&rsquo;s existing concept plan, will include a request&nbsp;<strong>to not overly narrow Ada Boulevard and</strong> <strong>keep the iconic rounded corners.</strong> These rounded corners are an important part of the heritage and identity of the community.</p>

			<p>The consultant is recommending that this alternate proposal be presented as one cohesive approach, so we will be bringing it forward as such. Although this alternative may not meet the individual desires of each homeowner, we have tried to arrive at a compromise which we hope the City will consider. It will be very helpful if we can show broad support for this alternate proposal.&nbsp; <strong>Please remember that all members of your household who are of voting age are eligible to answer this survey</strong>.</p>

			<p><strong>As time is important</strong>, can you please click on the following link to review the alternative approach design proposal and answer the few questions at the end. It is very important for you to complete these questions and press the <strong>FINISH</strong> button <strong>no later than Monday, Sept 28, 2020 </strong>since we have to take this to the City as soon as possible. If you have trouble accessing the link please let us know.&nbsp; We also realize some of the fonts used on the presentation may be difficult to read so please remember you can use your zoom function on your browser if needed.&nbsp;Thank you and please click on the following link below:</p>
