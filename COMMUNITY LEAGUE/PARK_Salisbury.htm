In recognition of Jane Thompson Salisbury, a past grand matron of the Order of the Eastern Star (the women&#39;s auxiliary of the Master Masons). Salisbury was born in Quebec but came to Edmonton as a child. She joined the Order of the Eastern Star in 1953 and was grand matron from 1976 to 1982. Salisbury spent almost 30 years volunteering with the elderly who lived in this community. From 1949 to 1987 senior citizens were housed in cottages in this park area, it was a project run by the Order of the Eastern Star. Location: Cromdale neighbourhood</font></font></p>

Such is the case with the Jane Salisbury Park. It cannot be seen from any road or street. The only people who would be aware of it are those whose homes abut the lane around the park. It is truly secluded. Perhaps the residents will not be happy to have it advertised!</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">The park is small and offers very little in the way of &#39;facilities&#39;. No children&#39;s swings,roundabouts or slides. There are but two benches. However what it does have to offer is solitude. During my two visits I found but one person in the park. The vista from either bench is not overpowering...in fact both look across a ravine... but that would be hard to detect from the benches as there is a row of shrubs that form a small barrier along the top edge of said ravine. This is Kinnaird Ravine. As an aside much culling of dead trees needs to be in the ravine.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">According to Randy Williamson, CBA, City of Edmonton Community Services Department there are approximately 88 trees in the park made up of many and various types of spruce, there are firs, lindens, larches, ash (two varieties) Mayday and Russian olive. The makeup of the trees is the standard for city parks. </font></font></p>
