			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" pbzloc="36" size="3">Formerly known as Highlands Baptist Church [after several years as the Neighbourhood the church reverted to its original name in 2018] This place of worship came about because a minister was cycling in the area and he felt there was a need for people to gather. So, in 1949 Sunday school was opened in Virginia Park Elementary School. </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">It was not long before a move was made to Mount Royal Elementary School and shortly thereafter the church moved into its first building on the southeast corner of 112 Avenue and 55 St. </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">It was a modest building, but over the years provided most of the programs available at<img align="left" alt="the Neighbourhood Church" height="150" hspace="10" src="higchu07.jpg" style="height: 245px; width: 295px" vspace="10" width="200" /> the time. These included Explorers, C.G.I.T. Cubs Scouts, Sunday school, Women&#39;s Auxiliary, later: Christian Service Brigade, and Chatta Box. These groups were always &#39;open&#39; that is children with or without church affiliations were welcomed.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">The church building has been modified twice. Many pastors have come on gone (at that time minsters tended to serve about 5 years before moving on.) The church strives to present the Gospel of Jesus Christ in a meaningful way, to enable people to live Christ-like lives; becoming positive examples of the Christian lifestyle in their communities.</font></p>

For example, there may have a fiery preacher , but no interest in Missions, or a strong Mission focus while neglecting the need for good speaking and reverent, meaningful Worship. This can leave church attendees incomplete in their Christian character. The development of the three parts of the circles, made up of Mission, Formation, and Worship is an attempt to &#39;bring forth&#39; Christian who have developed a complete character so as to function as competent Christians in their localities.</font></font></span></p>

At Highlands, our goal is to send our congregation to be Christ&#39;s presence in context. To do this, we need to understand the gifts and burdens of the congregation, and also to understand our context. Our intent is to find ways to engage the communities and neighborhoods around us in justice, mercy, humility, and the kingdom of God. Whether present in our local neighbourhoods, in the city at large, or in the larger global context, our aim is to be Christ&#39;s presence in that place.</font></font></font></span></p>

The formation team, made up of a director and two other team members, is responsible for organizing, facilitating and providing opportunities for members of our congregation to further explore and develop their faith, hopefully resulting in a greater depth of spiritual maturity and community. </font></font></font></span></p>

There is nothing wrong with this thinking, but it is only part of the process of worship. Our church has different aspects of worship coming together at different times to present a unified and worshipful atmosphere. Every effort is made to plan the worshipful outcome as being positive experience: God is properly worshipped.</font></font></font></span></p>

The music chosen must fit in with the pastor&#39;s sermon, and compliment other portions of the service, such as helping sending the children off to Sunday school, or suitable ambiance music for the communion service.</font></font></font></span></p>

			5347-112 Avenue NW and 6712-Delwood Rd N.W. Kevin, a personable man, with a ready smile, married to Cindy since 1995; they have three children, Ben (7), Caleb (9) and Charif (12). Their home is in the Delwood community.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Pastor Kevin, who regularly competes in strongman competitions, which allows two things: release of the stress from his day time job, meeting people of all, or no faith, in friendly competition, appears to have the vitality for the pastoral job with its many challenges!</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Having to &#39;mentor&#39; two sites has its challenges! He has to balance his personal liking and knowledge of his own community but also realizing he has to get a feel for the Highland-Bellevue area. These two areas have differing segments within the same area. He hopes &#39;his&#39; church will rise to the challenge of meeting the needs of all communities in which they serve.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">urch congregations are, like most churches, in the need of more people! Pastor Kevin rejects the idea that young persons are the church of the future. He emphatically states that all those attending both sites are<br />
			members of the present church and we must move ahead together. He agreed the business side of church life turns some off; feeling there was a need to simplify proceedings and still maintain a high degree of integrity in the processes. It would require some give and take from those on either side of the spectrum to achieve a better understanding of the legal requirements.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">In order for both sites to remain active and effective in the community, drastic actions would be required, requiring the cooperation of all who attended the church. He was confident on both fronts. Kevin would not speculate on future plans </span></p>
