Good afternoon John=E2=80=A6 thank you for your comments about the front =
yard=E2=80=A6 Pauline is the grower and I am just the mower=E2=80=A6 =
hence she gets the credit.

Pepe Hass was the son of Gaby Hass and a very good drummer and was =
married to Nicki Starr who lives in the family home (where the At Home =
open house is going to be in August for the Highlands Historical =
Society(see their web site for more information).  Pepe used to walk the =
neighbourhood and I often talked with him while out in the yard=E2=80=A6 =
a very nice gentleman who had a good history of the neighbourhood from =
his years here.  I do not know of any plaque for Judy McKinnon, maybe =
the community league should do a bench somewhere in her honour.

The issue with trying to stop the changes to the historic streetscape of =
south Highlands was very frustrating.  Brent Bain   brentbaim@gmail.com =
<mailto:brentbaim@gmail.com>. and his wife Anita Kuper =
kuperanita@gmail.com <mailto:kuperanita@gmail.com> along with Jeff Young =
jeff@bridgescatering.ca <mailto:jeff@bridgescatering.ca>. were the main =
entities in the Highlands Alliance that tried to stop the squaring off =
of the corners and the narrowing of Ada Blvd to the point where when a =
vehicle is parked on the north side of the road only one vehicle can =
pass=E2=80=A6 not sure how that can be safer than what we had.  Below is =
an e-mail we sent out to the folks who supported the Highlands =
Alliance=E2=80=A6 about 500 people living south of 112th avenue.  The =
proposal that we had developed and presented to council and =
administration cost us about $18,000 and basically the city said thank =
you it was a great proposal and then they did what they had planned =
prior to the first consultation period that was held several years ago.  =
Did they listen to the residents and those that pay taxes and live on =
these streets=E2=80=A6 NO they didn=E2=80=99t but we are trying to be =
positive and hope things work out after the work is completed. I am sure =
Brent or Jeff can fill you in with even more information if you are =
interested.  Tony Caterina was useless to us as he just supported the =
city position=E2=80=A6 glad he is going to run downtown and I hope he =
loses, but name recognition is so important in a municipal race so he =
will likely get in.

Message from the Friends of Highlands Alliance (FOHA)

For the past three years the FOHA have engaged the City of Edmonton to =
preserve the unique historical nature of Highlands.

We have spent many hours in meetings with various representatives from =
the City regarding the Highlands Neighborhood Renewal Project.  Our =
focus was to convince the City to mitigate proposed changes to the =
iconic curved corners found on various streets and avenues south of 112 =
Avenue, and to Ada Boulevard itself.

As many of you are aware, the original City proposal was to "square" the =
corners and construct a three meter wide shared use pathway (SUP), =
essentially a very large sidewalk, projecting from the existing south =
curb into the current Ada Boulevard.  After consulting, providing =
compelling evidence, educating, and sharing what we know with the City, =
there has been some compromise.  The "squared" corners will remain =
rounded, but the radius of the curve has been greatly reduced, so the =
width of the roadways at these intersections will also be significantly =
smaller than exists now.  Also, the City has agreed to narrow the SUP by =
half a metre, to 2.5 m.=20

This is the extent of concessions made by the City to their design.  =
After great, determined, and exhausting effort, FOHA believes that =
everything that could be done to convince the City to adapt further, has =
been done. We are grateful for the small concessions given by the City =
but remain disappointed that so many ideas and suggestions from =
Neighbours were not adopted.

As we move into construction this spring comments or inquiries would now =
be best directed to the city.   Further information can be found on the =
City of Edmonton neighborhood renewal website at =
www.edmonton.ca/transportation/on_your_streets/highlands-neighborhood-rene=
wal =
<http://www.edmonton.ca/transportation/on_your_streets/highlands-neighborh=
ood-renewal> and for questions specific to your property the Highlands =
project manager contact from the City is Richard Hai, =
Richard.hai@edmonton.ca <mailto:Richard.hai@edmonton.ca> .  =20


YEG Green Streets www.yeggreenstreets.ca =
<http://www.yeggreenstreets.ca/> is a grass roots Community initiative =
looking at exploring beautification efforts through sustainable =
landscaping initiatives.  Please visit the website and YEG Green Streets =
is looking for volunteers to help support the development of this =
program.  As FOHA we support this initiative as potentially a way to =
mitigate some of the impact from traffic calming architecture in =
neighborhood renewals and hopefully something can still be done in =
Highlands but there are no guarantees as the business model is still =
being developed and it will need the support of City Administration. As =
a result, if you have not already done so, residents should speak with =
the City about the impact of construction to their specific properties =
and the City=E2=80=99s current landscape plan in place to address these =
issues.  YEG Green Streets has asked if they can provide updates to the =
database of FOHA members and if you do not wish to receive these updates =
please respond to this email and your name and contact details will be =
removed.=20

We want to take this opportunity to thank everyone who submitted ideas, =
attended meetings, wrote letters, and tried to maintain the essence of =
our neighborhood. You have been on this journey with us and we =
appreciated both your support and/or interaction with FOHA.=20

Regards,

Friends of Highlands Steering Committee

Jeff, Ted, Darlene, Maureen, Brian, Anita, Gerry, Sandra, Bill, Brent, =
Carol, Craig

The Friends of Highlands Alliance is a large and growing group of =
concerned residents whose overarching goal has always been to =
collaborate with the City to find a more modest and cost-effective =
neighborhood renewal design that enhances safety and accessibility but =
at the same time maintains the historic identity of the Highlands =
neighborhood.=20


As a citizen, if you have questions or concerns about the overall =
Highlands Neighborhood renewal you can contact The Councilor for Ward 7 =
Tony Caterina, tony.caterina@edmonton.ca =
<mailto:tony.caterina@edmonton.ca> or for all Council members the email =
would be council@edmonton.ca <mailto:council@edmonton.ca> .




John, I do have some photographs of the historic streetscape and the =
painting of the lines on the corners that showed the neighbours and =
visitors just what the squared corners were going to look like if you =
would like some of those I could send them via e-mail.  The 2.5 meter =
shared use path on Ada Blvd (maybe we should call it Ada Lane or Alley =
now) was going to be 3M so that is the biggest concession that the city =
gave in the whole process.  There will be a wood fence on the section =
above the golf course parking lot (not the ugly metal fence past =
Concordia on Ada)=E2=80=A6 we hope it looks good but it will block the =
view a little of the folks living across from the golf course and it =
might limit views into the parking lot where we have had some vandalism =
and theft occur in the past years.  Wait to you see the new crosswalks =
going in at all the corners along Ada Blvd so people can get safely =
across the one lane to the shared use path.  There have already been =
some heated discussions on the shared use path between bikers and =
walkers.. pretty sure there will be more to come in the years ahead.

Am I bitter about the changes=E2=80=A6 yes I am.  An historic =
streetscape that we have enjoyed in this neighbourhood for over 100 =
years and was an important part of Magrath and Holegate=E2=80=99s vision =
for the Highlands in 1912 has been done away with and now we look like =
any other residential neighbourhood in Edmonton.  All this apparently in =
the Vision Zero safety program the city has embarked on.  Sorry John you =
caught me on my soapbox day=E2=80=A6 do contact Brent and Jeff to get =
their side of the story and if you want some of the photographs do let =
me know and I will forward some your way.  Stay well and thanks for the =
written words you are putting on paper (computer) to tell future =
generations our stories.  Maybe we will see you in the neighbourhood for =
a coffee once the construction is completed in a year or two. =20
