The source of the article has yet to be identified, but it does not appear in Edmonton Journal records.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" pbzloc="52" size="3">At a time when the news is more than ordinarily full of accounts of man&rsquo;s inhumanity to man, there is something vastly reassuring about the response to the disappearance of little Diane Mason. Despite its failure, the 4&frac12; day search for the missing child has been one of the most striking demonstrations of kindness and helpfulness in Alberta&rsquo;s history.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Perhaps as many as 20,000 Edmonton men women and children altogether joined in the extensive and exhausting search. Many undoubtedly gave up the whole holiday weekend for the purpose. Hundreds of private automobiles and scores or motor boats were placed at the disposal of the search directors, as well as a vast amount of smaller equipment, City restaurants, bakeries, groceries and packing houses and hundreds of housewives cooperated in supplying food for the searchers. Gasoline for vehicles was donated by local service stations. A special tribute is due to the congregation of Highlands Baptist Church, who made their church building available for search headquarters.</font></font></p>

			<p pbzloc="21" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">It is sad indeed that this great community effort has not been crowned with success. Nonetheless, it shows how the hearts of men and women will respond, in sympathy and helpfulness, to the trouble of others; and undoubtedly Edmontonians will still be hoping that some word of Diane will yet turn up.<font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"> </font></font></font></font></p>

A group of airmen were lined up at 127 Street and 118 Avenue (the girl was reported as being seen at this location) moving as a group towards the airport they searched in gardens and garbage cans. Each airman wore an armband of material similar to that of a dress worn by the little girl. Reaching the airport they were transported by truck to the Beverly Bridge and then searched the riverbank to the Dawson Bridge. He recalls the huge number of people who were provided food and drink at Highlands Baptist Church. A Highlands community man, Jack Unwin was the search master.</font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

Mrs. Sturko was apparently the driving force behind the church activities.</font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Apparently the homes of the Welsh&#39;s, the Traynors and the Sturko&#39;s were used and many searchers were fed. Vera Welsh, spoken to on February 28, 2003 did not recall it this way at all; she just remembers the church being used as the search headquarters. Another lady, ninety years old said, in spite of Journal reports saying the incident occurred in July, she was sure it was September. This was when her daughter joined the navy. She had also heard the little girl was seen in a vehicle, crying, near Fort St. John. So much for recent history, makes one wonder just how accurate ancient history is!!</font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

The only mention found was the incorrectly dated article found in the boxes of church material.</font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

The family had to leave the city because of harassment and extortion threats. Pamela said it was horrible for her parents. Crazy people phoning and demanding money, lying about being able to help them get Diane back. These persons were in addition to the ones phoning and berating them for losing their daughter. Pamela said her Mom and Dad and the boys (Pamela&rsquo;s older brothers) had a &quot;drill&quot; to use when answering the phone to do with turning on a reel to reel tape recorder: There just was no normal life for them, so they felt they must move. Pamela said for years after that they turned to look at every little blonde girl who came into view wondering if it was Diane.</font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

Bus drivers and others searched on their days off etc. A helicopter searched the river valley (first time one was used for this purpose). A RCMP dog was brought into from Stettler, but the trail was cold. John Tidridge interviewed then Constable Al. Boehm, now retired. Boehm remembered the incident well; he worked and went without food for about 30 hours. He said one suspect was questioned but released almost immediately. There were several unconfirmed sightings of the little girl throughout the city. Boehm thought that the little girl and her biological Dad were seen entering Alaska, USA. This sighting was n<img pbzloc="8" src="MASON%20D-10.jpg" style="border-top: 0px solid; height: 240px; border-right: 0px solid; width: 306px; border-bottom: 0px solid; float: right; border-left: 0px solid; margin: 25px" />ever&nbsp;confirmed; but Constable Boehm was confident the girl was not dead. </font></font></font></font><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" pbzloc="2" size="3">Detective Burkett, Missing Persons Unit, Edmonton City Police Service, did much work trying to uncover information, both in his own department and the R.C.M.P. but came up empty-handed.

Several interesting theories were offered. One involved the kidnapping of the child by a religious organization; another that the biological father was unhappy with the religious leanings of the adoptive parents so took his daughter back. There were sinister suggestions from one caller that because the adopted girl was Catholic, placed in a Protestant home, some government people were not happy. Bob Arsenault, connected with the adoption process, Provincial Government, was contacted. He said a file that old would have been purged by now. If it hadn&#39;t, it would be closed and could not be opened. Another version was that the Mason&rsquo;s were unhappy, divorced and the girl spirited away to the States to the paternal grandmother. Pamela Mason, who would have been Diane&rsquo;s sister, confirmed her mother believed it was the biological father most likely to have taken the girl. Another caller implied because it was a custodial dispute there would be no Police records. Another, involved in the search, which had finished at the then the City Dump now Rundle Golf Course, had been shown what was alleged to be a piece of the girl&#39;s dress. The police officer, whom he named, implied there was no chance of the girl being found again. The police officer is now deceased.</font></font></font></font></p>

My family, the Mason family and the Unwin family were close friends at the time. In fact we treated each other like family members enjoying holiday celebrations together; Christmas, Thanksgiving, July 1 etc. Diane was a little younger but had attended my 5th Birthday party around June 17, 1954 just before she disappeared. In fact the police developed and used photos from the party for the picture they circulated. </font></font></p>

			<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 40px">&nbsp;<font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="3">We moved from the distinct within a year but still kept close ties with the Masons for some years after as we still lived in Edmonton. Because of my age I only remember the line up of cars getting directions as to what area they should be looking. However I do recall years later that Mr. Mason was telling my father Mr. Ham that he was tired of checking girls identities for the police just in case one happened to be Diane. It was quite a strain emotionally for him. As both of my parents are deceased I cannot dispute any items. </font></font></p>

			<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 40px">&nbsp;<font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="3">Mrs Sturko had become like a grandmother to our family so I do know she would have been right there helping in the way she knew best and that is baking and cooking.</font></font></p>

			<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 40px">&nbsp;<font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="3">The Masons lived across the alley from us. Their back gate lead to our back yard which Diane was coming to on the day of her disappearance. We played most days so it was normal to be in either their yard or ours. Mrs. Mason was not as fast as Diane and she came over expecting Diane to be with my mother and myself. That was how fast the disappearance was. </font></font></p>

			<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 40px">&nbsp;<font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="3">The search was almost instant and the activity increased from there. Mr. Unwin [lived on 56 Street north of 111 Avenue] was an organizer and I believe people were there the same day starting to search everywhere. I remember my parents being told about the dress or piece of dress found but the search did not stop. From hearing talk among the adults/parents the police kept track of the Diane&#39;s birth parents for months if not longer as they were the main suspects. </font></font></p>

			<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 40px">&nbsp;<font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="3">Most of my memories of the Highlands are good ones as it was a great family neighborhood. Christmas time and July 1 were the best. Almost every yard had a skating rink, or at least ours did. It was a very unfortunate event but life went on and the three new Masons were loved and looked after. </font></font></p>

			<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 40px">&nbsp;<font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="3">Hi Again,</font></font></p>

			<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 40px">&nbsp;<font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="3">I know Mrs. Sturko was a strong member of the Church but I can not remember which church we attended as we moved before my 6th birthday to Holyrood area in Edmonton. What I remember are some of the gatherings with the Unwins and Masons. </font></font></p>

			<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 40px"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="3">Judy Unwin was the same age as myself, she had 2 older sisters; Patty, Judy and one younger Loie. I remember Lynn and Brian Mason, then the three younger Mason kids, Miles, Pam and Jimmy from get togethers after we moved. I even have a few photos. </font></font></p>

			<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 40px"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="3">Our house had an alley at the side and the back with the Mason&#39;s backyard right across from our side/back yard. The Unwin house was on the next street behind us so it was a trip down the side/back alley. Then either next door or one over were the Sproules (I may not be spelling this correctly) who also had children in the age group. I recall a family name Turner who had a couple or three boys older than my brother. </font></font></p>

			<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 40px">&nbsp;<font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="3">I have an older brother, Hugh born in 1947 and my younger brother, Gordon was born around 1955. He is in the age group with Loie Unwin and Miles Mason. My mother, Cathy passed away in 1994 and my Dad, Ken passed away in 2003.</font></font></p>

			<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 40px"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="3">My Dad worked in the oil field and would bring Christmas trees home just before Christmas and usually had more than one, so sometimes the school or church would get one too. Like I mentioned before, our parents still kept in touch with both the Unwins and Masons having them over to the new house. My dad worked a year or two with the same Insurance firm as Mr. Mason, then went back to oil companies. We moved to Calgary around 1965 and then we kept in touch with Mrs. Sturko until her death.</font></font></p>

			<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 40px"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="3">I do remember the zoo being near our home when we lived in the Highlands. In fact one day my older brother and a friend tried walking to the zoo. The zoo, such as it was, was a fair distance away, but perhaps not for young people of that time!]</font></font></p>

			<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 40px"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="3">After Diane disappeared there was not a lot a talk except maybe with the adults years after. I never knew about the other issues the Masons were having. I just thought it was awful about Mr. Mason having to constantly having to check out young girls who might be Diane even years after. I when I overhead Mr. Mason telling my dad and was so teary I then realized what an impact it had on the family. I was preteen when I heard the discussion. </font></font></p>

			<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 40px"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="3">The reason I found your article/write up about Diane was lately I have been going through photo albums and ran across several of the old neighbourhood and of the Unwins &amp; Masons. I never did forget about Diane&#39;s disappearance but then I never talked to anyone about it and never asked. As a child you hear things happen but do not relate to what actually was going on. </font></font></p>

			<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 40px"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="3">Sorry I do not remember the names you asked about or the Church. I attended Mrs. Sturko&#39;s church a few times growing up as she sometimes babysat us over the years. Like I stated she was my grandmother figure. She could not attend my wedding as it was the year Mr. Sturko was confined to the hospital and he died months later. I remember my address from Holyrood 9316 82 Ave but only part of the Highlands I remember is 114. and the top of the hill leading down to the river was just a partial block from our corner to the south, west was the street the Unwins lived and east was where the Sturkos lived. Mrs Sturko always baked and you never got just one cookie but one for each hand. </font></font></p>

			<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 40px"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="3">I have enjoyed recalling this and I hope the information helps to fill in areas or gives the background you were looking for. </font></font></p>

			<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm; margin-left: 40px"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="3">Wow I believe you are correct. I googled the address and the house looks like the one I lived in (a little smaller maybe). My room was upstairs facing the river so at Christmas time you could see the colorful lights on the refineries. The fire hydrant on the corner was a marker for our bike riding as you always had to be able to see it and not cross the streets. Mrs Sturko lived in the cul-de-sac. </font></font></p>

			<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm; margin-left: 40px"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="3">Mum said she knew when to go to tea with Mrs Sturko as Mrs Sturko held the tea kettle up in her kitchen widow and Mum could see it from our house. Never did test that out. I was actually told that our house was torn down years ago and I didn&#39;t check that out either. </font></font></p>

			<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 40px"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="3">Thank you for the address. </font></font></p>
