			<p><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Why bother? McDonald&#39;s has gone, it is history and no-one cares...but obviously someone does care and as one talks to former members who remain it would be criminal not to record some of the life of the former church. The intent is to develop just a few notes so that others may know of the church.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">IN THE BEGINNING McDonald (Memorial) Church originally called Syndicate Avenue Baptist Church, was located at 95 Street and 106A Avenue (Syndicate Avenue and Morris Street) and started out in a tent. Syndicate was possibly a planting of First Baptist Church and was legally incorporated on September 7, 1910. A Mr. Shelford Grimwood , newly arrived from England was involved in the church. By 1912 the church moved to 108 Avenue and 93 Street and the name was called McDonald (Memorial) Baptist Church in honour of a Baptist pioneer. It seems appropriate at this point to include an article on Rev. McDonald. See below. </font></p>

			<p><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">TALES OF EARLY DAYS</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">October 2, 1954: Baptist Pioneer Played Important Part In West, By &quot;OLD TIMER&quot; Among the pioneer churchmen of the northwest was, a pastor whose work dates to 1873 at Winnipeg, and to whom more than one district owes its start. He was Rev. Alexander McDonald &quot;Pioneer McDonald&quot; of the Baptist Church in the west.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">It was Pioneer McDonald who built the first brick church in Edmonton, in 1893. For him, Baptists of Edmonton built a memorial church while he was still living - McDonald Memorial Church, erected in 1907.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Mr. McDonald&#39;s connection with the western prairies dates from the early 1890&#39;s, after a term spent in the United States; He had built a church at Winnipeg in 1874 with a congregation of seven members and nine years later became a missionary-at-large.</font></p>

			<p><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><b>ORGANIZED IN 1893 </b></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">When Mr. McDonald came to Edmonton and organized his first congregation in 1893, he was following in the footsteps of Rev. H.G. Mellick, the superintendent of Baptist missions in the west in the years 1892-97. Mr. Mellick came to Edmonton in &#39;92, the year he took over the superintendency, and held the town&#39;s first Baptist service. </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">On Feb, 19, 1893, Mr. McDonald organized a Baptist congregation of 19 members and began building his original brick church. It was opened for services in November, 1893.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Pastor McDonald stayed eight years with his First Baptist Church congregation, and then resigned to move away. He didn&#39;t go far, however; just across the river, where he took charge of the growing Strathcona Baptist congregation.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">&quot;Pioneer&quot; McDonald stayed with the Strathcona church for two years, and then moved to Leduc in 1903. He built a church there, and in order to provide funds for this project, the pastor mortgaged his own home. He died eight years later, in 1911; four years after McDonald Memorial Church had been built to honor [sic] his services to the Baptist congregations of the west.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">And, here is a little more about the Church, this time from a CFRN Television Broadcast in 1965 </font></p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<center><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><b>THE STORY OF THE MCDONALD MEMORIAL BAPTIST CHURCH AS TOLD BY HARRY FARMER, PRODUCER OF THE CFRN TELEVISION SERIES &quot;SUNDAY VISIT&quot;. Circa September 1965</b></font></center>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">In 1907, before Edmonton&#39;s streets and avenues were numbered, a group of people living near Syndicate Avenue decided to form a Baptist Church and, like so many other early church congregations, they went out and bought themselves a tent.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">A description of those early days was given in an Eastern Canadian newspaper article by the first pastor. The Rev. Herbert S. Sneyd&hellip; and here are a few excerpts from it... </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">&quot;Worshipping in a tent during the winter months may be something of a novelty to our Eastern friends but, as is so often said, necessity is the Mother of Invention and, finding it impossible to secure a suitable building for the winter, the church had to resort to the popular mode of living in this province and go tenting&hellip;fortunately we have been favored [sic] with a mild winter&hellip;The tent is comfortable but it is too small, accommodating only about 150 people. Our congregations are increasing and the Sunday School has doubled in the past two months. </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Edmonton is a very important field, being the capital city and the great railway centre of the Province of Alberta. To the north of us is the Norwood district, near where the Grand Trunk Pacific have secured a site for their shops, and this is filling up rapidly. We have already three families in this part and it is possible that a mission will have to be opened this summer. </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">The same thing is true of the growth with Bro. McDonald&#39;s work in the centre and West end of the city&hellip;signed Rev. H.S. Sneyd&quot;. </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">During the following five years the hard working Rev. H. S. Sneyd and the Rev. Alexander McDonald increased the numbers of Baptist worshippers in the city and, in 1912, when the Syndicate Avenue congregation built their fine large brick church on the corner of Ottawa Avenue and Picard street, they named it McDonald Memorial Baptist Church.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">In the 53 years it has stood on its commanding site the McDonald Church has seen many changes in the families living close to it and, today, it reminds one of a dignified Victorian grandmother who has seen her offspring move away from home to use their abilities in fields afar, yet always ready to welcome them back with a loving embrace.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Like an understanding old lady, she opens her arms to strangers, too, making every effort to make them feel at home&hellip;and the new families in the district have benefitted from her guiding influence. Most of them are new to this country and one of the outstanding projects of today&#39;s congregational members has been the teaching of basic English to the new Canadians.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">To establish this service called for a great deal of unselfish work on the part of the members and the active young people of the Church, many of whom travel from far parts of the City to worship there, delivered pamphlets printed in Italian, German and French to the doors of hundreds of homes in the area.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">One is inclined to think of new undeveloped fields when missionary work is mentioned but, here, right in the heart of Edmonton, is the challenge which is being met by the efforts of the Rev. R. B. Salmon and his helpers.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">With no expectation of reward in the shape of larger congregations or converts, the true missionaries of McDonald Church are shaping the Edmonton to come.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Help is given in other ways besides the English classes and the work at the Hope Mission has benefited the young people&#39;s enthusiasm for Christian endeavour.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">In 1933 the youth groups presented the church with a new pulpit&hellip;and the table was installed at the thirtieth anniversary celebration as a memorial to Mr. Grimwood who, in 1913, was the church clerk. Mr. Grimwood&#39;s work in the church went far beyond that of clerk, however, and when, at one time in its history, there was a danger of its falling apart...his was the strength which healed the breech and set it on its way forward once again.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">There is no lack of optimism in the church although the number of Baptist families living in close proximity could be counted on the fingers of the hands, and the latest project is the re-building of the pipe organ which has been in the building for many years.</font></p>

			<p><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><b>CHURCH NAME</b></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">The official name of Syndicate Avenue Baptist Church remained until 1934 when the new name was recorded with the authorities. The &#39;new&#39; church was never McDonald Memorial Church legally but when Syndicate was renamed the church became McDonald Baptist Church of Edmonton on January 17, 1934. Appendix 25 It is obvious; however, the new name had been used since at least 1913!! </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">There is no record of what kind of building replaced the tent at 95 Street and 106A Avenue. There is a record of what happened to the building as recorded in a letter from the Church to a lawyer requesting he undertake the name change of the church...the paragraph reads as follows:</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">The congregation of Syndicate Ave. Church moved into its new building now known as McDonald Baptist in the fall of 1912 and have been worshipping here ever since. The old building was sold and turned into a residence.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">The lawyer&#39;s fee for the process was $5.00!</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">A Constitution was developed by 1913 and follows: The author highlighted a couple of areas of interest, to him!!</font></p>

Artrobus stating that owing to pressure of work in MacDonald [sic] Church, the board was sorry that they were unable to accede to this request . Meeting adjourned at 9.30 p.m. The general style of the minutes did not vary throughout the seven year period. It is interesting to note (or is it?) that in the minutes of September 1939 and January 1940 there is no mention made of World War II, likewise, there is no mention of the Pearl Harbour attack in the minutes. Selected highlights&hellip;. July 31, 1936: Board approved the request of the Alberta Government to use the church for registering citizens for social credit dividends October 31, 1936: Board expresses concern for the apparent lack of spiritual life in the church as evidenced by the poor attendance at mid-week services. Louis Kabesh January 18, 1940 Mr. Louis Kabesh slated for baptism. January 27, 1936: The deacons discussed a will leaving money to the church in the amount of $20.00 and 20% of the balance of the estate&hellip;one must read int o this statement the cause of the discussion&hellip;it was not the intention of the board to protest the widow&rsquo;s application&rsquo;. It was moved that the pastor write to Montreal Trust and inform them of the stand taken by the board. May 27, 1937 Board agrees to present a new Constitution to the congregation. See Appendix 26 There are a couple of interesting features in the Constitution: 7. CONDUCT OF MEMBERS Holding as a general principle, the principles of conduct outlined in the church covenant requires that any recalcitrant member shall be dealt with as follows: Any person whose conduct is considered in any way injurious to the Church and its work shall be approached by a committee of the deacons with or without the pastor, as is deemed best, with a view to leading the recalcitrant member to reconsideration of his or her mode or life and to acknowledging or guilt in regard to previous wrong doing. Continuance in such wrong doing shall necessitate a, further interview and the whole matter shall be brought to the attention of the Deacon&#39;s Board. If wrong doing still continues, the matter shall be brought before the members of the church who may, if unanimously they think best, suspend the wrongdoer from membership in the church, temporarily or permanently, always seeking to protect the best interests of the wrongdoer and to seek his or her restoration to right conduct. Opposition to the best interests of the church group shall be deemed grounds for with a member as outlined above. ABSENTEES Where persons absent themselves from attendance upon (from) services of worship in this church over an extended period (six months ) or more it shall be the duty of the pastor or deacons to endeavor [sic] to find out reasons for such non-attendance. If the absence is by reason of circumstances over which there is no control, e.g. removal to another part of the country, sickness, attendance upon the sick or special work, etc. an absentee membership list shall be struck and the name of such person placed upon the list until permanent removal from the church group or until attendance upon services is again possible. Where absence is occasioned not of necessity but by carelessness, lack of harmony, indifference, etc. the deacon shall seek to discover the reasons for absence. After such reasons have been investigated and the person concerned has been spoken to in this regard the deacons shall present a report of their investigation to the church quarterly or annual business meeting and may recommend that the name of such person be dropped from the membership list after due notice has been given to the person concerned. After a member has absented himself or herself for a year without adequate reason, an investigation shall be made with a view to restoration of the indifferent person to attendance upon services of worship or to removal of the name from the membership list automatically where no response is forthcoming. June 29, 1938: Mr. Stibbards talked of his meetings held in regard to mix(ed) drinking All the churches have (a) petition to sign. If we can get enough signatures perhaps it will not be voted upon August 6, 1938: Agreed that members of the deacons board donate .50c a piece for the services of Edgar Borchert as supply on July 24. December 30, 1940: First item of new business was the zone prayer meetings. It was moved that we have these meetings on the 2nd Wednesday in Feb - Feb 12th Mr. Shade was put in charge of asking permission for the use of homes in the districts. (Five homes were selected) The deacons working in each district to see that all members know about this meeting. September 29, 1941: Arising from the minutes, discussion was held on Mr. Grimwood&rsquo;s suggestion of a Photo Gallery in the church of those boys, members and adherents who were in active service. It was decided that a committee of three be appointed to carry on work deciding how to contact and communicate with these boys on approval of the deacons&rsquo; board. Premier Manning November 10, 1941: &ldquo;Bundles had been sent to the boys overseas and work being carried out on other suggestions on how best to communicate with the boys overseas.&rdquo; It was also agreed that the Sacrament of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper be held during a Sunday school period December 1, 1941: In a report given on the above item&hellip;it was noted that about 51 scholars and teachers took part. After the service several young people spoke to the pastor about becoming baptized June 21, 1942: Letter from Mr. Ernest Manning, Premier of Alberta agreeing to preach, and asking for the use of the baptistry form those wishing to be baptized as the result of services being held in a Masonic Lodge. Board agrees to allow the use but adds a small fee to cover the cost of the heating. September 7, 1942 Mr. Manning of the newly formed Fundamental Baptist Church would still require the use of the baptistery.

Edmonton Journal December 3 1966 Anyone want to buy an organ with memories? The pipe organ in McDonald Baptist Church, 108th Avenue and 93rd Street, has played before movies and ministers. The church can be bought for $65,000. The organ, an old vaudeville piano, pews, kitchen equipment and furniture are all included. McDonald organ&hellip;.. The church bought the organ from the old Empress Theatre, which stood on the site of the Royal Bank Building. When the &quot;talkies&quot; came in, the organ went out. McDonald Baptist bought it in 1942 and members of the congregation took it apart and put it back together again in the church. &quot;None of us knew what we were doing. A couple of books from the library helped quite a bit,&quot; said Mrs. Douglas Thomson. She and her husband, Rev. Harold Stibbards and Ronald Shonn worked on the organ every day for three months. Mrs. Thomson said there were about l00 pipes in the organ. The organ had to be reassembled in a different form because of the differing amounts of space in the theatre and the church. The grand piano that stands in an alcove near the organ also has a history of show business. It came from the Strand Theatre, a vaudeville house. Members of the congregation decided in September to sell the church. Chairman of the board of deacons and trustees, Scott Shade, said there were only 75 active members of the church left. Most of the members were older people and their children were no longer living in the centre of the city, he said. Mr. Shade said none of the members lived near the church but came to it out of loyalty. &quot;We weren&#39;t going down in membership but we were stagnant.&quot; The last regular service was held at the end of June. &#39;The minister, Rev. Ray Salmon, went to First Baptist Church in Prince Albert and the congregation decided to amalgamate with Highlands Baptist Church. And now for a different version some 20 years later&hellip;.. THE SOUND OF MUSIC &amp;h ellip;.from Real Estate Weekly December 1986 By Alex Mair A Well Known Native Edmonton Freelance Author and Speaker. There&#39;s an old, red brick church tucked into a quiet neighborhood [sic] in the McCauley district of central Edmonton, and if the bricks could .talk, they&#39;d tell you the most amazing story of the sound of music that has come from its sanctuary over the years. You&#39;ll find the building at the corner of 93 Street and 108 Avenue, and you&#39;ll find that it is still ministering to the needs of the Edmonton community. It&#39;s a little harder to find the story of the organ that once supplied the music for the church. In the early 1940&#39;s, this little brick building housed what was called MacDonald [sic] Baptist Church, The minister was a fellow called Harold Stibbards and in many ways he was unique among ministers. While he was an excellent Clergyman, he was also very capable with things mechanical and things electrical. Harold Stibbards was an amateur radio operator, and he built many of the components he used in his ham set. He had a Scout troop at the church, and he built a table-top Morse code training unit that enabled all of the members of the troop to sit behind a Morse key, and conduct coded conversations with other Scouts around the table. And Harold Stibbards was concerned about the music that was such an important part of his Baptist worship service. The church, you see, didn&#39;t have a proper organ. It&#39;s hard to say what other clergyman would have done in the circumstances, but Harold Stibbards approached the problem from a rather different angle. You have to remember that this was back in the late 30&#39;s, and small congregations didn&#39;t have large lumps of money to spend on fine organs. That, however, didn&#39;t stop Harold Stibbards. Back in the days of silent movies, theatres used pipe organs to supply the background music for the films, or for entertainment before and after the movie. Theatres in Edmonton were no exception, and the Reverend Harold Stibbards began some discreet investigations. He soon discovered that the Empress Theatre right here in Edmonton had, at one time, been equipped with just such a pipe organ and that the organ, after the introduction of talking pictures, had fallen into disuse. The organ had, as a matter of fact, been taken apart and hidden in the basement, and the organ, in pieces, was still in the basement of the Empress Theatre. One thing led to another, and MacDonald [sic] Baptist acquired the organ from the Empress Theatre. The musical instrument that had once supplied the background music for Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and the Keystone Cops came out of retirement and made the move to the church at 93 Street and 108 Avenue. Harold Stibbards, with the help of one of the young men in the congregation moved the parts to the church, cleaned them, put them in working order, and assembled them in the sanctuary of the church. The helper was a fellow called Doug McLeod, now living in retirement on Saltspring Island in British Columbia. Neither Doug nor Harold Stibbards were particularly knowledgeable about pipe organs. Things mechanical, things electrical, and there were no problems. Organs, on the other hand, were a little strange. But they got all the pieces together, they installed them in what seemed to be the right places, and the organ made music. They were very pleased with the whole operation. They then called in a professional organist and asked her opinion about the sound of their newly restored pipe organ. She listened, .she complimented them on the sound, but added that it was the first pipe organ she had ever heard which had the bass pipes installed on the right and treble pipes on the left. It seems, apparently, that when Harold Stibbards and Doug (Thomson?) McLeod labelled the organ parts they were facing one direction, and when they put them back together they were facing in the other direction. The organ worked perfectly, they just had it installed backwards With those little details attended to, the organ went into service and performed for years. The original installation was made in 1940, and the only frustrating part of the story is trying to find out what eventually happened to the organ from the Empress Theatre. MacDonald [sic] Baptist Church changed hands a number of times over the years. It currently houses the Edmonton Chinese Baptist Church. A conversation with the current minister of the church reveals that the organ is no longer there, and that he has no idea where it went or when. But he does have a suggestion. He thinks perhaps someone at the People&#39;s Church, 11205 - 101 Street, might be able to help. A visit to the People&#39;s Church and a conversation with Paul Armfield moves you closer to an answer. The People&#39;s Church had, at one time, made their church home in what had been MacDonald [sic] Baptist. When they took over the building, the old organ had been in place. The organ had worked well over the years and had been maintained by an Edmonton organ tuner, name unknown. The Pastor at the People&#39;s Church recalled that the organ tuner had always said that if the church ever decided to sell the organ, that he would like to buy it and install it in his rumpus room, and that as far as he knew, that&#39;s what had happened to the old organ from the Empress Theatre. Perhaps it&#39;s just as well to let the history of the old organ rest in peace at this point. It&#39;s a nice thought to imagine that the musical instrument that had brought the sound of music to the City of Edmonton over all those years is still bringing the sound of music to the home of a retired organ tuner Following the trail of the organ&hellip;.. Found in material from McDonald Church the following note entitled Re: disposal of Assets, To: The Members of McDonald Church, was found which reads in part: Dated August 1, 1966: (c) the assessment of the chattels including the organ will be divided between the BLTS and the Highlands Church (d) If the Building is sold for other purposes the chattels will be sold and given to BLTS except the organ which will be given the Highlands Church. Another note dated 19 October 1966, but unsigned indicated: Scott: It was concluded that the present value of the organ &rdquo;where is-as is&rdquo; is approximately $5000.00 including pipe work now in use, and that to remove and reinstall same in another local church in first class condition and guaranteed, will cost an additional $5000.00 more or less. The following entry was found in the Quarterly Business Meeting covering the period January to April 1962: The Finance Committee was contacted by Mrs. Thomson to see if it would be possible to have the organ overhauled. From the Finance Committee: As most of you know the organ had been kept in a state repair all these years by Dorothy and Doug Thomson with no cost to the church, and we feel it is time that a major renovation be undertaken. The Finance Committee recommends to the Church that the above project be done. The Deacons&rsquo; Board recommends: (1) That this church undertake a programme of renovation of our choir loft, the purchase of a new organ console and electrification of the organ pipe work controls &hellip; Nothing further found on the organ&hellip;..

They suggest starting at 7:30 p.m. and having about ten minutes of singing prolonging the service at the other end rather than commencing any earlier. We would be ready to commence Sunday Dec 18th if desired. Yours very truly, McDonald Baptist Choir Per E. Allan Sec. 1939-1940-Pledge Card 1941-42-Yearly Report of the Mission Circle Attendance average 24 Calls 115 During the year we entertained the following speakers: Mrs. Gainor, Mrs. Oldring, Mrs. Duncan Ritchie, Mrs. Barker Smith and Mrs. Grace Knight. Mrs. Gainor spoke of Baptist Mission work, Mrs. Oldring on Jewish Christian Mission work, Mrs. Barker Smith told of the work of the United Church Indian Mission schools twenty miles N.W. of the city and brought some samples of the handicrafts work of the pupils. A new mission circle of young married women was formed and is showing splendid progress. Several of the younger members joined this group. We were entertained at the affiliation service by the CGIT girls. Mrs. Grimwood our president was presented with a Life membership pin. Two former members passed away during the year, Mrs. Vance and Mrs. Waddington We had the pleasure of presenting flowers and birthday cakes to Mrs. Whitfield on her 80th birthday and Mrs. Gilmore (?) on her 85th birthday. As it is no longer possible to send white cross work to India, it has been decided to send money amounting to what is usually expended on mailing the goods. On May 14th the members of Bonnie Doon and Delton were guests at the annual birthday meetings and appreciated very much a talk by Dr. Jessie Allan on the medical and evangelistic work on the Baptist Mission field in India Mrs. Mitchell Secretary 1942-05-20-Secretary and Treasurer Report of the Junior Mission Band The Junior Mission Circle was organized Oct last with an enrollment of 13 members, which since has increased to 18 with an average attendance of 14. The meetings consist of, first a devotional period then a study of missions in different fields and the time left is used in knitting and sewing. The members are divided into three groups and each group in turn is responsible for the meeting. We have sent an afghan to England each member making part of it. Each group has been responsible for making a layette and we now have three ready to be sent to West Ham Central Mission in London Enough money was collected from the members for wool for the afghan but each member had to supply her part of the layette. On Jan 1st we started the mission envelopes and set our budget at $10.00 to be raised by May 10th up to that date we collected $13.20 which was turned over to the Baptist Mission.

I should like to urge and impress upon every Church, the absolute necessity of registering delegates early, if they are to receive the hospitality of Calgary Baptists. In these war days, billets are very difficult to find; we are therefore asking that every Church Clerk return the enclosed form, fully completed, by June 15th at the latest. We cannot guarantee a billet for any delegate registered later than this date. If no delegate can come from your Church, would you please indicate on the form, and return it so that we may know how many to expect. I sincerely hope, however, that every Church will make every effort to be represented. I am writing also to ask if you would bring before your Church, the question of making it possible for your Pastor to attend the Convention. I need hardly stress the importance of the Convention, and the benefit that not only your Pastor, but your Church through him, would derive from his attendance at these sessions. There are two ways in which you could assist your pastor, first, by seeing to it that the pulpit is supplied for Sunday June 25th; and second, by any financial help that might seem advisable. It might not be possible for the minister to finance the trip himself, but a small contribution from each member of the Church would make up the necessary amount, and I am sure that you would find yourself well repaid in making this effort. I may say that you r pastor does not know that I am making this suggestion. With every good wish, I am, Yours sincerely, W.C.

It was not only deemed advisable but necessary by the officers and staff, to divide what was formerly the Senior Sunday School into two sections: a Junior and Senior. This was necessary after it appeared that the younger students did not seem to benefit from the curriculum as much as the older scholars were doing. The dividing age was set at approximately twelve and a new plan was introduced for the younger members of the school. This is a novel method of teaching facts of the Bible. This plan is under the willing and capable hands of Alf. Davies, who has shown leadership and originality in the organization of his fine work in the Junior School. In the upper school a new course has been introduced in some of our classes. This is called the story of our Bible and although the outlay for the necessary literature was $25.00 pastor has considered it money well spent.. Every four weeks the two sections of the school combine at the end of class for the closing exercises. In this way it is felt that the two school swill not grow too far apart. A new assistant has been appointed to help the Treas. in his work. It may be noted that the Sec/Treas. has lost no time in putting his colleague to work. Cash on hand as of Nov. 13/44 totalled $166.98. Following this there was a disbursement of $25.00 which left a balance of $141.98. The attendance e up until two weeks ago had shown a discouraging decrease but since that time the figures have been more favourable. Receipt of religious publications have not been as prompt and reliable as might be desired and by an urgent inquiry to the publishers in Toronto is has been ascertained that there is a shortage of papers and a systems of restrictions has been introduced. However, recent word seems to indicate that a more satisfactory system will be inaugurated During the past few sessions of the school old editions have been distributed and it seems that this plan will be a passable method until deliveries assume a more reliable basis. An even more prosperous report is anticipated for next quarter.

Among our various activities were: a bicycle hike and corn roast, moving pictures on the development of Russia, collecting for the British &amp; Foreign Bible Society and a discussion on &quot;The United Church of Canada. Special speakers included our pastor and Chaplain Cox of the U.S. Army Air Force who spoke on the interesting subject of Courtship and Marriage, after which the meeting was thrown open for discussion. Our young people&rsquo;s society is divided into three groups, with one group being in charge of each meeting. Our average attendance has been 20. Among our visitors have been soldiers from the American Army base here. Donations received for parcels which we have sent to the boys from our church who are overseas amounted to $39.00 to date. Total cash on hand is $10.15. Milt.

There are 26 members on the roll. The average attendance is 20. Activities during the quarter: During this quarter we completed the list of parcels to the boys from our church and congregation who are serving overseas. On October 10th the ladies catered to the Annual Church Banquet. On November the 18th we will be catering to a supper for the Leaders of the Boys Work Board. At our last meeting it was decided to make berets for the Explorers Group.

There was an initial enrollment of six or seven boys. Since then there have been a good number of new lads join our group. There have been three boys who have moved from the area and one or two others that have come a time or two and dropped out. The present enrollment is over twenty. On the whole the attendance is good and the interest is keen. In addition to the standard work set forth on the &quot;Explorer&#39;s Log&quot; eac h boy is learning how to weave belts. A simple, yet we believe, attractive type of uniform is being presented to the boys. We feel that it promotes interest and a feeling of group solidarity. We have made the group a closed one. That is, only boys who come to our Sunday School are allowed to join. This may keep the occasional boy away but it will increase the religious training of the lads who do come and at present we have all we can do to train our present group. We feel that the four senior boys who have helped the pastor deserve not only his thanks, which they mast cordially have, but should have the heartfelt appreciation of the entire church.

GEORGE W. CAMPBELL B.A., B.D. Chairman, Jubilee Committee: 9323 &ndash; l08A Avenue~. Mr. S. Grimwood, 11726 - 89 St April 6, 1957. Dear Friends, Fifty years ago this summer our church was founded under the name of Syndicate Avenue Baptist Church, Five years later a new site was secured and the present building was erected and named in memory of Rev. Alexander McDonald, the great pioneer Baptist in Western Canada. Plans are now underway for our Golden Jubilee, Rev. A.C. Bingham has agreed to return as guest speaker Sunday, September 15, 1957, and we hope to have a mass choir of former and present members. If you could participate in such a choir please let us know soon. Monday, September l6, we are planning a reunion social which will provide opportunity to renew acquaintances and revive old memories. On the concluding evening, Tuesday, September 17, recordings by and pictures of former ministers will revive their memory, and we can reminisce to heart&#39;s content. This is a Golden Jubilee and Reunion - no attempt will be made to raise funds of any sort. If your parting from us meant leaving Edmonton, perhaps you have never returned. If so, this would be a golden opportunity to see former friends, the growth of the city, and your former church home as it now is. If you wish help in securing accommodation we will be only too glad to assist, and hope to provide limited billeting where needed. You can help us mostly by just coming, If this is not possible, please send a picture of yourself and family (kindly place name and address on the back) and any message you may think appropriate. We are trying to secure addresses of all former members. If you know of any please send us this information. We do not want to miss anyone. Fifty years is a long time. Won&#39;t you come back again to see friends with whom you once worked and worshipped. The following committee is planning for our Jubilee: Mrs. W.H. McLeod Mrs. S. Grimwood Mrs. E.R.

The church for many years had a large Young Peoples&#39; group and was a progressive church. , Recently the church voted to amalgamate with Highlands Baptist Church. The building was then put up for sale. It first came to the attention of the present pastors early in December, 1966 when one of the teachers at Northwest Bible College mentioned it by way of an illustration. During the course of the next six months efforts were made to purchase it until finally on May 20th, 1967 the purchase of the building became a reality. The money for, the purchase was raised by the sale of bonds to various interested individuals. We now look forward to seeing God&#39;s continued guidance in the formation and growth of a Sunday School and a congregation FROM AN INSERT IN THE BULLETIN: DESCRIPTION OF THE CHURCH McDonald Baptist Church is situated on the corner of 93 Street and 108 Avenue.

Last October in my Boy&rsquo;s Club move to Gyro Park activities (against it) I had a personal interview with the R.C. priests of the three R.C. Churches in this area. In those talks I learned that the R.C. Church, in the long view, has its eye on the properties of both McDonald and the Lutheran Church on 94 St. and 109A Avenue, to consolidate their holdings in this area. I am sorry the church is letting the lord down in this district. It is needed here. Most of the Italians do not go to church. If they love Italian people as they so vociferously protest, they should be staying not moving. Yours for staying Elsie Wright 1966-05-23-Letter from Scott Shade to Bruce McLean 12044-101st Edmonton, Alta Mr. R.B. Mclean 5332-111 Avenue Edmonton.

Should these recommendations be accepted they will then be presented to the members of the Highlands Baptist Church, and if they meet with t heir approval, amalgamation papers can then be signed.

I am still hoping McDonald can go on. In a few years the Baptist Union will say they should have and we will want a church in the area. My idea: Could a meeting be called of those who wish to go on, leaving out the deserters, and see if it could be financed for a year or two or more. Then if we go in the red &ndash; well! I believe we could double up ort triple our givings and succeed if it is God&rsquo;s will. I&rsquo;d like us to try it and be very sure God wants the church to duck out before we duck. I am prepared to be immersed, if the church continues, and all my support is yours. Elsie Wright. 1966-09-08-Progress Report-Shade To Mclean Sept. 8/66 Mr. R.B. 5332-111 Ave. Edmonton Dear Bruce, If all goes well things should move a little faster than they have in the past. I am enclosing a copy of the disposition (of) our assets in hope that it&rsquo;s (a) hurdle now overcome should start proceedings for amalgamation with your church without further delay. I think it is self explanatory but should you wish further information please give me a call. I will keep you informed on the progress and when the time comes make arrangements to meet with your board. I hope your church members will approve and that they will understand that the McDonald members in had (to) do this in their own way and we hope it will benefit many who maybe in need for a little help. Thank you for many past favours, W.S. Shade Chairman of Trustees. HANDWRITTEN 1966-09-09-Shade To Patch-Disposal Of Assets W.S.

Would you please advise me in the following. To put this property in your hands&hellip;&hellip;.. Do you take over completely, or do we have to take care of the building until it has been sold? The right steps for amalgamation. We would appreciate all you can do for us. This letter will give you the authority from our Members to proceed with the sale. Due to the time it takes to look after these three matters, we will discus our loan with you at a later time, when the time comes to dispose of that part of the assets.

Dear Mr. Shade: We would like to thank you for the letter showing of the disposition of the assets of McDonald Church, and which shows that Highlands Church will receive your organ. We thank you very much for this offer, which was brought to our deacon&#39;s meeting on Monday Sept. 12th, The possibility of having the organ moved and other matters relating to this will be gone into thoroughly so this will probably take a little time. If you have tables and other furniture which will be for sale, we would appreciate having the opportunity to purchase this from you. It was suggested that a joint meeting of our two boards be held on Sept. 19th, but owing to the short notice, we will leave it up to you to inform us when it would be convenient for you. I will be away until Sunday evening if you would like to phone me then. Yours truly R. B.

Dear Mr. Shade: Only a previous engagement which was of long standing kept me from being present at the significant service this afternoon marking the conclusion of the ministry of McDonald Memorial Baptist Church at this location. No one can say that the work is actually concluded; the seeds sown through the decades will continue to bear rich harvest in the lives of men and women. We think of those who have gone out into the ministry of Jesus Christ and into the service of His Kingdom. An influence beyond calculation is still being exercised and will be through all time and eternity. &quot;New occasions teach new duties&quot; and a Church that is flexible enough in its thinking and great enough in spirit to see its life contribute to the growth of other congregations is indeed a true Church of Jesus Christ. Many remember with great affection the ministry of the Church which holds its last formal service today and when the story of God is work in Edmonton is finally written, the chapter headed McDonald Baptist Church will be one of the most significant. May God bless the members as they find new Church homes, new spheres of influence and witness. Yours in Christian fellowship, J. Frank Patch, .

Dear Mr. Shade: Mr. Delicate of the Independent Insurance Exchange called us last Friday to enquire about the insurance on the McDonald Church, and it seemed to me that you were the best one to consult. He said that Insurance companies do not like to keep full insurance coverage on an empty building which is not to be used again by the 0wners. At present you have $100,000 on the building (which is certainly &#39;replacement&#39; rather than &#39;actual&#39; value) $15,000 on the organ, and a further amount which I do not remember, on the other contents. He suggested that perhaps the building should be reduced to $40,000, with organ and contents left as at present. This would amount to a reduction in premium. Would this be satisfactory to the trustees? He also asked what supervision is being given to the building. Is the heat, light &amp; water left turned on? Does anyone inspect the premises and if so how often? Any information you can give the insuring Company along this line will affect the premium rate. May we hear from you just as soon as possible? With all good wishes, Yours sincerely Office secretary mt/ 1967-01-07-Letter To B.U.W.C. Re: Mission Budget January 6, 1967 Rev. Frank Patch Baptist Union Office Edmonton, Alta. Dear Mr. Patch: In regards to the Mission Budget of the McDonald Baptist Church, I believe that you are aware that it was voted to pay the remaining portion of the budget. It should be in the neighbourhood of fourteen hundred dollars. I am sure your office will have the exact figures After talking it over with the trustees and not wishing to deplete our current account, we wondered if this money could be retransferred from our loan with the Union so that it may be paid before the 13th of January, which is our closing out date. If this can be done would you be kind enough to send me a financial statement of the transaction when it is completed. Thank you, Sincerely, W.S.

Two Northwest Bible College students have put $500 down on McDonald Memorial Baptist Church, 93rd St. and 108th Ave., and they hope to raise the remaining $25,500 by selling bonds at six per cent interest. Dennis Sunderland, 21, and Laurie Hueppelsheuser, 19, have one year of Bible College behind them, and will not be ordained for another two years. &#39;People&#39;s Church&#39; They plan to move into a large room behind the church and open their &quot;Peoples&#39; Church&quot; May 21. The church will be affiliated with the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada. A few young people are going to join the church when it opens, the two students said. They plan to canvass the area around the church, to enlist members. A teacher mentioned the church was for sale last December, and since then Mr. Sunderland and Mr. Hueppelsheuser have been working on their project. Statistics From the city they obtained statistics on the area. With a little research of their own, they have compiled a complete statistical picture of the area. They know the ethnic backgrounds and the religious preferences of the people living there, and they are confident of being able to find enough members to support the church. The $500 down payment was donated to them. Mr. Sunderland and Mr. Hueppelsheuser have presented a six-page brief to church boards and presbyters five times since they came up with the idea of starting their own church. To Sell Bonds They will be selling $50, $100, $500, and $1,000 bonds to make up the remainder of the sale price to people they know are interested, and to people who come to them. &quot;It is a matter of faith to us that we will be able to raise the money,&quot; said Mr. Sunderland. He said they hope to bring in prominent speakers to attract people. There will be services twice a day and a Sunday school, he said. 1967-05-31-Mcdonald Church Sale-To Peoples&rsquo; Pentecostal FIELD., HYNDMAN, FIELD, OWEN, BLAKEY t3 BODNER BARRISTERS AND SOLICITORS FILE NUMBER: 8 - 67855 May 31, 1967.

Across the road from this school is the location of the new Baptist Church, the first unit of which is now in the process of erection. We give everyone a very hearty invitation to worship with us. During the service a Sunday school program will be conducted for primary and beginner scholars. It is recommended that at this service the new Church to be known possibly as the HIGHLANDS BAPTIST CHURCH will be formed. A charter members list will begin and those wishing to be members of it may indicate same to a clerk who shall be elected and who will write to the respective churches named for letters of transfer. Those wishing to join by Christian experience may indicate same at that time . Our aim is to serve the community as a whole in every possible way. Hence an invitation is extended to all. We give a special welcome to the children of the neighbourhood who may wish to come to our Sunday school. There will be classes in the school for all. Services of the church and its various organizations which will be established, will, of necessity, be limited to the Sunday hour at present-until the first unit of our Church will be completed, which, we hope, will be soon. Trusting to see you all on Sunday, November 25th at 11 a.m. and praying the blessing of God on our endeavours as we launch out on this new venture of faith with Him, we are, Sincerely yours for Christian Fellowship, Raymond F. LeDrew, Minister, McDonald Church Appendix 02-Letter to board re: change of membership requirements The Chairman of the Board of Deacons of Highlands Baptist Church: A group comprised of members of Highlands Baptist Church, after prayerful deliberation, makes the following representation to the Board of Deacons of this church: We request that a study group, open to all interested persons, be formed at once to thoroughly search out the New Testament teaching on Believer&#39;s Baptism. In connection with this study, we ask that either the Executive Minister of the Baptist Union of Western Canada, the Rev. Harry A. Renfree, or the Area Minister for Alberta, the Rev. R. C. Standerwick, or the Rev. Donald Burke, Pastor of Braemar Church, Edmonton, be asked to hold a series of meetings in Highlands Baptist Church as soon as possible. Let us each ask himself whether or not the proposed changes are scriptural. We present the following statistics, with the request that they be brought before and imparted to each member of this church: &quot;A recent study that has been made of the four open-membership Baptist churches in the Chicago Baptist Association reveals that these churches all lost in membership in a fifteen-year period, the average loss per church being 51. If all Baptist churches suffered the same rate of loss, the denomination would become completely extinct in approximately one hundred and forty years. &quot;During this same fifteen-year period the other Baptist churches in the Chicago Association experienced an average gain per church of 41 members. In baptisms the contrast is even greater, for the &quot;closed&quot; churches baptized 44 per cent more in that period than the &quot;open&quot; churches did. Also in giving to benevolence the &quot;closed&quot; churches did 45 per cent better than the &quot;open&quot; churches in maintaining the level of giving at the beginning of the fifteen-year period. Further statistics are available. Let us each ask himself whether or not the proposed changes are advisable. We suggest that as a member of a larger organization, i.e. The Baptist Union of Western Canada, we carry a responsibility for loyalty. The bond of Christian love and spiritual strength is an enriching one to each church. This fellowship could be weakened, or altered, by change in our local Church. Let us each ask himself whether or not the proposed changes are spiritually sound. As of December 17, 1967, a Notice of Motion stands before this Church, to wit: &quot;I hereby give due notice that on January 24, 1968, the Annual Meeting of this Church, I shall move or cause to be moved the following motion: &quot;That such constitutional changes as are incorporated in the Revised Draft Constitution (so labelled) be adopted, which document is posted on the bulletin board. Signed, W. S. Shade&quot; We ask that in consideration of the foregoing representation, the Notice of Motion be tabled. Dated: January 7, 1968 Signed C.

Dear Mr. Statz: Your letter of January 7 was considered at our Deacons&#39; meeting which had been called for this afternoon to consider the format for next Sunday&#39;s discussion meeting. It had already been decided at our meeting of last Monday to recommend further consideration of the matters in the revised constitution which merit further prayerful consideration. However, there are statutory and mechanical problems occasioned by our new status as a body corporate and by the amalgamation of the two Churches which merit immediate attention. There are also rational amendments providing for effective and up-to date administration. It was our intention, therefore to ask that the motion be presented; for consideration by sections, and that motions to table certain sections be entertained. To expedite matters, we can assure you that we intended to offer for further consideration the section on membership. Any member is free to raise any matter for consideration by a duly constituted meeting and we trust that you will submit for the agenda matters of mutual concern in which we are acting in good faith and in which we have and will seek the guidance and prayers of every member. Yours Sincerely, HIGHLANDS BAPTIST CHURCH DEACONS BOARD, Per: (no name) CHAIRMAN. * address of Bruce Mclean Appendix 04-Letter from pastor urging attendance Highlands Baptist Church Edmonton, Alberta January 18, 1968 To All Active Resident Members of the Highlands Baptist Church Dear Christian Friends~ This letter brings you a copy of the proposed constitutional changes, and is to inform you of two important events: 1.

Please bring the enclosed booklet to the two meetings. Appendix 05-Church Covenant and proposed Bylaw changes CHURCH COVENANT Having been led as we believe by the Spirit of &quot;God, to receive the Lord Jesus Christ as our Saviour, and having publicly professed our faith in Him, we do now in the presence of God and this assembly most solemnly and joyfully enter into covenant with one another, as one body in Christ. We promise by the aid of the Holy Spirit, to participate fully in the life and work of this church; to strive for the growth of this church in faith, hope and love; and to maintain its worship, educational program, ordinances, discipline and doctrines. We also promise to contribute regularly and sacrificially to the support of its ministry, the expenses of the church, the service of mankind, and the proclamation of the gospel throughout the world. We promise to watch over one another in brotherly love, to remember one another in prayer, and to aid each other in sickness and distress. We promise to seek a fuller understanding of the Bible and of the redeeming love of God; to train our children in the teaching and practice of the Christian faith; and to relate our faith to others in word and in deed. We also promise readily to work with Christians everywhere for the promotion of freedom, justice and goodwill among all men, regardless of race, colour, nationality, or religious and political persuasion. Finally, we promise that on leaving this community we will seek to unite with some other church, where we can carry out the spirit of this covenant. APPENDIX &ldquo;A&rdquo; MEMBERSHIP Membership in this Church shall be a vital relationship.

By Exclusion Should any member become an offense to this Church by reason of deliberate unchristian conduct, or by persistent breach of his covenant vows, the Church may terminate his membership. Only after due notice and a hearing before the Board of Deacons, and after prayerful and patient efforts have been made to bring the member to repentance, should such action be taken. 4. By Erasure 5. The Board of Deacons shall prepare, annually, a list of members who have, for a period on one year or more, failed to participate in the public worship, the educational program, or the financial support of the Church, without valid reasons. If after personal contact and/or correspondence, they are convinced that such persons cannot be reclaimed, they shall present to the Annual Meeting of the Church a recommendation that the names of these delinquent members be erased from the membership roll. Upon such action being taken by the Church, said members shall thereafter cease to be members of this Church Non-resident members shall be continued only under exceptional circumstances. (This Church Covenant and Appendix &ldquo;A Membership&rdquo; are all part of a Notice of Motion that contains the proposed changes to the present Constitution of the Highlands Baptist Church, Edmonton.

Hugh James Dear Mr. James: Further to notice of motion tabled at our church Meeting of April 29, 1956, and duly approved and seconded at our general Meeting of May 9, the members of Highlands Baptist Church ballot unanimously endorsed the following resolution, &ldquo;That a call to the ministry of Highlands Baptist Church be issued to the reverend High James of Olds, Alberta. &ldquo;More than one hour&rsquo;s prayerful consideration was given to this motion before we concluded that it would be in the interest of His Kingdom that we ask you to set yourself aside for service in this portion of His vineyard. In fairness, careful consideration was given to the matter of our capacity to issue such a call. We wish to confirm the financial arrangements as submitted to you on behalf of our Finance Committee, viz: 1. That until a suitable manse can be obtained, our church will provide an over-all salary of $4000.00 per annum to cover all forms of allowances. 2. That subsequent arrangement will be the result of our working and praying together. In committing ourselves to this salary our capital payments on our mortgage will be temporarily reduced by 50%, but we feel confident that in Meeting the spiritual challenge in the community we can also surmount he any physical challenge. While anxious to respect the needs of your people at Olds, we ask that a reply to this call be given your prayerful thought as soon as possible. With due respect for the needs of others we ask that this call, if accepted, be acted on as soon as arrangements can be made to provide for your people. In anticipation of your possible acceptance, we have Committees working on every aspect of acquiring suitable accommodation. Should you accept our call, we would appreciate your views in this matter. In the meantime, ours is merely a fact-finding effort. Yours in His Service, Chairman, Pulpit Committee On June 7, 1956 Hugh James accepted the call Members and Friends The Highlands Baptist Church Edmonton Alberta Dear Fellow Workers, This is to inform you that after careful a prayerful consideration I feel led of the Lord to accept your gracious invitation to become pastor of your church. Our resignation from the Olds Baptist Church was formally accepted last night and will become effective August 31. We believe we could begin our ministry in your church on Sunday, September 9. The work of the Lord present a challenge everywhere, but we are assured that you have a unique opportunity to proclaim the Gospel in the Highlands of Edmonton. We do not feel in any sense worthy or capable to lead you in the wonderful work which you are doing there, but we are confident that through much prayer and consecration we will be able to work together in the extension of God&rsquo;s Kingdom in that part of the great harvest field. We are uncertain what to suggest regarding housing. We do feel that it might be in the best interests of your church extension project if we were to seek accommodation so that you would not need to incur further indebtedness at this time. However we will not take any steps in this regard until we have had further conference with your church leaders. May God richly bless your work during the summer months, and we look forward with keen anticipation to being wit h you in September. Yours in Christ&rsquo;s Glad Service, Hugh D. James. Appendix 11-Letter from pastor asking for an increase in salary Minister: REV. H. G. RATH, B.D. 11242 -55 ST. 479-4767 Clerk: MRS. M. G. WERNER 11118-69ST. January 31, 1969 Board of Deacons Highlands Baptist Church c/o. Mr. W. S. Shade Chairman 12044- 101 Street Edmonton 18, Alberta. Dear Scott: When I accepted the call to Highlands, I indicated to the Chairman of the Pulpit Committee that I would not hesitate, at any time, to inform the Church about my financial needs. I find myself now in circumstances that force me to approach you in this regard. I am very grateful for the annual increase in salary of $200 granted to me at the Annual Business Meeting last Wednesday, January 29th. Unfortunately, this amount is not sufficient to offset the rising cost of living and a number of major expenditures I am faced with this year. I also feel the time has come that I should begin to lay aside for the future a certain sum regularly and systematically. On the day when most people retire in their own home, having lived in church-owned parsonages Mrs. Rath and I shall find ourselves unprotected. Furthermore, I am sad to confess that we have not been able to give a tithe to the Lord&#39;s work during the last two years. The situation is becoming critical now. Last Monday I had to borrow money from the bank, so that I could pay for a much-needed new suit of clothing. Our kitchen stove and living room furniture need immediate replacement. They were purchased in used condition eight years ago for $35 and $15 respectively and are now beyond repair. The refrigerator ($40 eight years ago) may also require replacement very soon. Our children&#39;s bedrooms have never seen as yet any proper furniture. No money is available to pay for any of the items just mentioned. The next two months will be particularly critical, because a number of insurance premiums are falling due which cannot be postponed. My present salary, as you are aware, is $4040, plus $1200 car allowance, $200 pension contributions, and free telephone. For comparison, the minister of Braemar Baptist Church- a bachelor -last year received a salary of $6,100, plus $1200 car allowance, $200 pension contributions, $400 summer school allowance, free telephone, and free utilities (app. $200). I dislike to admit that I often worry about my financial situation; however, the fact remains that my resources are grossly inadequate to meet the personal needs of my young family and professional expenses, such as business dress, books, subscriptions to professional journals, meals away from home, etc. In the light of the foregoing, I wish to request that the Church review my present salary and allowances. Appendix 12-New suggested format for services The Church School Staff decided at their last meeting, on June 2, `1969, to recommend to the Board of Deacons and the Church the following changes in the Sunday morning schedule, starting September 7: WHEREAS we believe that it is essential for the life and witness of our congregation that each member of the family actively participate in both worship and Church School experience; AND WHEREAS the Church School is suffering from decreasing attendance; AND WHEREAS, from year to year, the Church School encounters great difficulties in procuring teachers (e.g., mothers of infant children); AND WHEREAS the total length of the Sunday morning program, from 9:45 a.m. to 12:10 p.m., is felt to be too long and discourages the children, young people and some teachers from attending the worship service following Church School; AND WHEREAS the proposed changes will tend to make the best possible use of the new Faith and Work Plan teaching materials in a small church such as ours: 1. That the worship service begin at 10:3o a.m.; 2. That the opening exercises of the Church School be incorporated into the worship service; 3. That the combined worship service be limited to 45 minutes until 11:15 a.m.; 4. That at 11:15 a.m. every one proceed to his respective Church School class; 5. That the Church School extend for 40 minutes until 11:55 a.m.; 6. That at the conclusion of the Church School everyone reassemble in the sanctuary for dismissal and the benediction; 7. That the closing assembly be considered the end of the integrated Church School-and-worship program; 8. That in the case of a communion service, the Lord&rsquo;s Supper be observed following the aforementioned closing assembly, at about 12 noon; 9. That, if considered advisable, children 8 years and under be dismissed for Church School immediately prior to the sermon, and that these children be engaged in handicrafts as part of their prolonged Church School period; and 10. That Nursery facilities be offered during the total length of the morning program, from 10:30 a.m. to 12 noon. We believe the following to be some of the advantages and disadvantages with the proposed changes: Disadvantages 1. Longer nursery hours; 2. Half-hour earlier start of worship service; 3. Half-hour longer service since the worship is not formally concluded until after the Church School period. Advantages 1. Everyone will feel encouraged to participate in the Church School 2. More parents may be interested in going to church with their children, instead of simply sending them to Church School, owing to the added convenience of Nursery facilities during Church School and of the condensed, and hence shorter, time schedule; 3. More persons will become available for teaching duties; 4. The saving of three-quarters hour of time without any loss of content; 5. The combined worship session will encourage greater attendance and active participation of children, young people and adults in the worship service. 6. The size of the adult classes will increase significantly, perhaps leading to the forming of several adult study groups, 7. The integrated program will discourage people (incl. children) from only attending either Church School or the worship service; 8. Since with the introduction of the Faith and Work Plan teaching material of all age groups study the same basic theme Sunday by Sunday, the sermon can be preparatory for the class periods following; 9. Shorter sermon (pastor consents!) 10. All classes will be challenged to use the Faith and Work Plan teaching materials. Thus, all members of a family will go home having studied the same basic lesion theme on any given Sunday. This, in turn, will help them share with each other what they have learned.. Thank you for your kind attention to this matter. Appendix 13-Letter of resignation REV. H. G. RATH, July 24, 1969 11242 -55 St. 479-4787 The Chairman of the Board of Deacons and the Members of the Congregation of the Highlands Baptist Church Dear Mr. Shade and Friends and Members, of the Highlands Baptist Church: It is with a heavy heart I must inform you that I have accepted the position of Manpower Counsellor with the Public Service of Canada, commencing September I, 1969. This step on my part necessitates that I resign as full-time Pastor of the Highlands Baptist Church, effective that date. Many of you will be very disappointed in this my action. I wish to assure you, however, that I am not acting from flagging zeal for Christ&#39;s cause, but rather because of increasing concern for it. I can no longer justify to my conscience the fact that a large proportion of the Church&#39;s budget is being spent on maintaining the full-time pastoral ministry of such a small active congregation as ours. During the past three years, I have tried to give of my best in Christ&#39;s service among you: to proclaim the Gospel of the Saviour in word and in deed; to challenge the committed; .to encourage the afflicted; to develop a youth ministry; and to serve the Church of Jesus Christ, locally, denominationally, and ecumenically. Yet it is evident I have largely failed to inspire the kind of support that might have filled this congregation with fervent evangelical concern for the troubled, the loveless and the lost. In fairness to you, and to my wife and family and myself, therefore, I am left with no other honourable alternative but to resi gn. However, if it should be the wish and will of the Highlands Baptist Church, I am prepared to continue to serve after August 31 in the capacity of a Pastor on a spare time basis. In closing, I should like to say to one and all that I treasure the times -of joy and of ill - I have been privileged to be Christ&#39;s under-shepherd to you. Though I am leaving the full-time Christian ministry as traditionally defined, I shall remain a pastor at heart whom God may use as He sees fit, Thank you, dear friends, for sustaining your Pastor, his wife and family for the past three years with your generous love and prayers. May the Heavenly Father bless you and, for the sake of His kingdom, prosper the fellowship in Christ at the Highlands Baptist Church. Lovingly yours, Pastor Rath Appendix 14-Deaconesses Finances Receipts Fellowship Offering Upper Room sales Transfer from Mrs. King 105.82 7.80 6.15 119.77 Expenditures Communion juice Upper Room books Aged Ministers Fund Christmas fruit baskets Balance carried over from 1962 Balance at December 31, 1963 2.00 6.24 25.00 14.00 44.27 72.53 38.15 110.68 Appendix 15 54th cub pack- advised to seek new program for boys June 1969 54th Highlands Baptist Cub Pack Quarterly Report 3 Leaders 30 Cubs It is the writer&rsquo;s opinion that the New Cub Program, as understood by the writer, is no longer a suitable program to be sponsored by a church concerned with Christian Education. The present program is permissive in that it allows a boy to much freedom of choice at an age (8-11) where he should be receiving the basic rights and wrongs of being a Christian citizen. The writer suggests that the church look very closely at its mid-week program for boys. The other leaders do not disagree with the writer. Yours sincerely, John Tidridge Appendix 16-Education Committee WHERE IS OUR CHRISTIAN EDUCATION COMMITTEE? In our Church Constitution, section E of Standing Committees, we read: The Christian Education Committee is a committee of&#39; those responsible for Christian Education in the church. Its functions shall be to co-ordinate the work of those responsible for the Christian education of our children and young people, and to make recommendations to the Church regarding projects and commitments involving youth groups and their leaders. The personnel is outlined there. I believe it is long past time that this Committee became active. Why, in this age of&#39; organization, this age of specialization, this age of efficiency, do we Baptists leave so much to chance? Why do we continue to abuse the freedom which we claim under Christ? We Baptists are &quot;bound&quot; by freedom. Children in this land are being encouraged in many quarters to respect no wisdom but their own, and we are &lsquo;partners in crime&rsquo; when we as a church take no real responsibility for what is taught or what is not taught. As a traveller I may know the destination I want to reach, but if I have no road map or refuse to use one I will most likely go a long way round in trying to get there, and I may even get lost. A well-defined &quot;program&#39;, carefully and prayerfully prepared by dedicated, trained and experienced leaders, will in no way limit any group. Such a program, if accepted and respected, will increase immeasurably the effectiveness of the group. I believe that it should be the concern and responsibility of the C.E. committee to see that the purpose, policy and program&quot; of each organization is prayerfully prepared and care-fully recorded (probably in triplicate) for easy reference. This article may contain what you feel are exaggerations. Let me say that it is not intended to be controversial; it is intended to stimulate -thought and action in regard to the very important work of&#39; Christian Education. I am well aware of the good work that is being done by our dedicated leaders, but I believe that as a church (represented by a C.E. Committee) we can offer them more in the way of guidance and intelligent support. The following are just a few of the questions that keep popping up, unanswered, out of situations which recur year after year: 1. To whom does a leader give his or her resignation and who is responsible for finding, appointing and instructing a new leader? 2. Who decides the age limits in any group? 3. Who decides that a new group shall or shall not be formed? 4. Who knows whether our Mission work is being presented and supported adequately or at all? in all of our organizations? 5. What guidance is being given our young church members and our potential church members in the privileges and the responsibilities of church membership? or of membership in any group? 6. Is the proper conduct of business considered a necessary part of for training of young people? or adults? Are group treasurers required to keep correct accounts and to have them audited? 7. Are our children and young people learning how .to conduct a worship service or (more important) how to conduct themselves in a worship service? Do we have a definite place for instruction of our people, both young and old, so that they may be able to meet and master the onslaught of changing moral standards, of the many &ldquo;isms&quot; of our day &ndash; communism, materialism, Mormonism, J.W. ism, etc. etc. etc. As a church member and as a parent of 5 little &ldquo;young people&rdquo; I have long been concerned regarding our lack of definition of program and policy. Organization in itself is not enough but if it is respected and used it is the vehicle in which we may move more surely and swiftly to our goal. The power which moves the vehicle will come through prayer. Let us take steps to ensure that our best is given to this great task which is entrusted to us in Highlands Baptist Church. Appendix 17-Church school proposal-Cost of program RECOMMENDATION from the C.E. Committee to the Quarterly Meeting: WHEREAS the educational program of the Church is the responsibility of all its members, and WHEREAS weekly offerings taken during our Sunday Church School have been in the past year less in total than the cost of normal yearly operation, and in particular less than the cost of curriculum materials, and WHEREAS it is deemed desirable to have the status of the Church School kept before the congregation and integrated into the general Church program THEREFORE the Christian Education Committee hereby recommends that the Church School be given an operating grant each year based on the previous year&#39;s expenditures, and be formally incorporated into the Church&#39;s yearly budget and quarterly financial statements. It is intended that the Church School would continue to pay its own bills and bank its weekly offering, but that the mechanics be worked out in a satisfactory manner between the Church School Treasurer and the Finance Committee in the event that the above recommendation meet with general agreement of the Church Congregation. Appendix 18-Christian Education Committee-Guidelines From the Constitution (5) Christian Education Committee The Christian Education Committee is a committee of those responsible for Christian Education in the church. Its functions shall be to coordinate the work of Christian Education, and to make recommendations to the church regarding projects and commitments involving groups and their leaders. The personnel of the Christian Education Committee shall be the following by virtue of their office and such others as the Committee shall appoint: the Minister, the Superintendent of the Sunday School, the Chairman of the Deacons&#39; Board, the Chairman of the Deaconesses, the leaders or sponsors of the following: Canadian Girls in Training, Explorers, Boy Scouts, Cubs, Young People&#39;s, and such other Christian Education groups as shall be organized in the church.

This personality sketch of Mr. Shelford Grimwood is by Dr. W.C. Smalley of Edmonton. Any lis t of prominent Canadian Baptist laymen which did not include the name of Shelford Grimwood of Edmonton, Alta., would be decidedly incomplete. Shelford Grimwood Shelford Grimwood was born in England, where in due time he was converted and united with the church. Speaking of his early Christian experience, he pays tribute to his Christian home, the faithfulness of Sunday school teachers, and for the privilege of doing Christian work under the auspices of the Christian Endeavor [sic] movement, in which he had the opportunity of partaking in open air meetings. Here he met the girl who became his wife, and who through the years since has been his faithful companion in many forms of Christian activity. In 1902 Mr. Grimwood went to South Africa, towards the close of the war, and at once took active part in Christian service. A year later he was elected a deacon of the Pretoria Baptist Church. As part of his Christian activity he interested himself in the condition of the natives in the compounds in the district, and was instrumental in getting some of them to attend the church services. Mr. Grimwood returned to England in 1905 to be married. While there, he interviewed Dr. John Clifford in the interests of Baptist work in South Africa, and looks upon this experience as one of the highlights of his long career. Mr. and Mrs. Grimwood heard Dr. A. J. Vining speak in 1908 in Fuller Church, Kettering, and responded to the speaker&#39;s urgent appeal for Christian laymen to come to Canada, particularly the Canadian West. Coming to Canada, they stayed for three years in Toronto, uniting first with Jarvis St. Church, and later with First Avenue Church, where Mr. Grimwood became organist. On their departure for Western Canada, the church granted Mr. Grimwood a license to preach, signed by Dr. W. T. Graham the pastor. This document is still one of his prized possessions. On arrival in Edmonton, the Grimwoods united with the Syndicate Ave. Baptist Church (now McDonald Memorial Church), and assisted that comparatively new cause in establishing itself on an enduring foundation. With the outbreak of World War I, Mr. Grimwood enlisted in a Canadian unit and served for four-and-a-half years, two of them in France. He was on the headquarters staff of a cavalry division for a time. Through the war years he was promoted Corporal, Sergeant, Sergeant Major, and later given a commission. Returning to Canada after the war, Mr. and Mrs. Grimwood, and six others settled in the Peace River district, and along with the Rev. A. J. D. and Mrs. Milton organized the Peace River Baptist Church. As Field Inspector and Appraiser of Lands for the Dominion Government, Mr. Grimwood had opportunity to visit many isolated Baptists in the northland. Always interested in music, he organized the Community Choir at Peace River of fifty voices, out of which grew the Musical Festival of Peace and Grande Country. On the transfer of the resources to the Provincial Government, the Grimwoods returned to Edmonton in 1930, and rejoined the McDonald Memorial Church. Here he served as choir leader, deacon, and in other capacities. Happily, he and his wife are still with us. Not only has Mr. Grimwood been a stalwart supporter of his own church, a regular worshipper at its services, and the friend and confident of the various pastors; he has also taken an active part in the affairs of the denomination. He has served as president of the Baptist Union of Western Canada, and for many years on its executive board; as moderator of the Edmonton-Peace River Association; and for thirteen years as secretary-treasurer, a position he relinquished only last year. It is a high privilege to know and work with the Grimwoods. Shelford Grimwood&#39;s colorful [sic] career is characterized by his loyalty to Christ, his devotion in His service, his painstaking efficiency in anything he undertakes, his fearless furtherance of what he deems to be right, his willingness to cooperate with his brethren in the extension of the Kingdom, and the warmth and durability of his friendship. Looking back over his Christian experience, and looking out over the opportunities in the Church today, Mr. Grimwood makes these observations: Total surrender of one&#39;s life and dedication to Christian service is basic in the Christian life. Allow Christ to have pre-eminence. Be loyal to your church connections by accepting responsibility for upholding your share of the work. Do not let outside affiliations hinder your work in the church. I have found it best to resign from such connections rather than drop my responsibility in Christ&#39;s service. Do not rush into marriage. Think well ahead, and seek a partner who is in full sympathy with the church in which you are interested. I have found it pays! Take an active part in Sunday school work. Join the young people&#39;s group - be alive there in the Master&#39;s Kingdom. Last, but not least, be loyal to your pastor. If he is not the ideal pastor in your opinion, help to make it possible for him to become so!&quot; Though now retired, the influence and interest of Mr. and Mrs. Grimwood does not wane. Our prayer is that they may long be with us. May they find pleasure in watching the progress of events in the cause for which they have labored [sic] so long and so successfully. Without doubt, there are many people who through the years have felt the warmth and the influence of Mr. and Mrs. Grimwood&#39;s Christian witness, and who fervently thank God for the privilege of knowing them.

After such reasons have been investigated and the person concerned has been spoken to in this regard the deacons shall present a report of their investigation to the church quarterly or annual business meeting and may recommend that the name of such person be dropped from the membership list after due notice has been given to the person concerned. After a member has absented himself or herself for a year without adequate reason, an investigation shall be made with a view to restoration of the indifferent person to attendance upon services of worship or to removal of the name from the membership list automatically where no response is forthcoming. 9. CHANGES IN CONSTITUTION: Changes in this constitution may be made at any annual business meeting by a majority vote of two-thirds of those present. Only vitally important changes shall be made at any other time. All changes shall be governed by the rule that notice of motion shall be given of such change at the next regular business meeting preceding the giving of the motion. Any such change shall be then posted on the church bulletin board at least a month before the annual business meeting or such specially called meeting as may be desired. 10. AUDITORS: Two members shall be appointed at the annual meeting to serve as auditors for the ensuing church year. </font>
