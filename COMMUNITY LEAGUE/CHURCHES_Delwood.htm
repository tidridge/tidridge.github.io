			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">There was a 75<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Church History Booklet created in November, 1996 summarizing the history of Delton Baptist/Delwood Road Baptist Church. These next few pages are a short summary of the next seven years of ministry at Delwood Road Baptist Church before the church joined with Highlands Baptist Church under the umbrella of The Neighbourhood Church, Highlands Site and Delwood Site.</font></p>

			<p><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">1997</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Pastor Stutterheim established a new organizational format in which Director&#39;s, composed of all who were in positions of leadership in the church, would become the decision making body for the future direction of ministries rather than the previous &quot;Commissions&quot; format. The Director&#39;s met on Saturday mornings to discuss the business of the church and to make sure all committees knew what was happening in all areas.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Helen Colville continued volunteering as Church Secretary as well as looking after visitation to the sick and the elderly. Derrick Pendleton started as the janitor at Delwood, relieving families of the responsibility of the weekly cleaning. Judy Pearce took over looking after the Youth Group until a youth leader stepped forward.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">The Preschool run in the church involved 20 families, many of whom were community folks. There were 13 youth involved in the Youth Group. Shelly Mottershead did an excellent job of running both these groups.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Accepted into membership was, by transfer, Susan Laycock, our worship leader, and Leo and Jeannie Papadopoulos, new members. A letter of transfer was sent for Angie Robichaud as she was worshiping at a church close to her home. There was an outdoor baptismal service for six people held at Pembina Provincial Park in the river.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Speakers for the nursery were installed so workers could still hear the sermon. Sermons were also to be taped. A Spring cleanup and potluck was held May 24<sup>th.</sup> New windows were installed at the church, two furnace motors were replaced and the existing lawn mower was restored.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Daily Vacation Bible School was held August 11-15 with the wind-up taking place on the Sunday which included a Barbecue following the closing rally.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">A Fall Friendship Weekend was planned at the beginning of September with a Saturday Carnival for the neighbourhood, Open house so neighbours could see our church and Sunday potluck. The portable was painted by the youth and youth friendly furnishings were installed. The purpose of the weekend was to welcome the neighbourhood to the activities and worship services at the church. A teen concert in the sanctuary was held on Saturday evening. The whole weekend was a great success.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">One M &amp; M night (Family night) prepared a spaghetti dinner fund raiser for raising money to send needy children to Gull Lake Camp. A Christmas Banquet was held on December 12<sup>th</sup>, and, as usual, was a full house as we worshiped and celebrated the Christmas season together. Neil McLean of Mustard Seed Street Church was the guest speaker.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Missions we were supporting were Canadian Baptist Mission, Gull Lake, Retired Pastors Fund, Pregnancy Counselling Centre, Western Canada Missions, Neighbourhood Link, Mustard Seed.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">The Adeline Carlson Mission Circle supported Gull Lake, Canadian Bible Society, Operation Eyesight, Pregnancy Counselling Centre, Leprosy Mission, Cornerstone Counselling and Hope Mission. They also purchased Poinsettias for Christmas and following their use at church sold them or gifted them to others.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Active groups within this year were the Men&#39;s Bible Study, Men&#39;s Saturday Morning Breakfast, Prime Time (Saturday morning prayer and breakfast meeting), Tuesday evening bible study at Clarks, M &amp; M (Family nights) at the church, ladies mid-week bible study (Max Lacado at Helen Colville&#39;s home), Youth Group, two adult Sunday School classes and an active Junior Church program as well as Sunday School classes. A Small Group was involved in the study of &quot;Sharing and Defending Your Faith&quot;. The Deacons began a Visitation Time on Wednesday evenings to meet with church members and pray with them. Blair and Valerie Scranton served at Northway Lodge, attending once a month to provide music and an opportunity to attend worship service to the people who lived there. The participants saw Blair as their &quot;pastor&quot; and enjoyed the Scrantons&#39; ministry to them. The Clarks were instrumental in keeping us involved in the Neighbour Link ministry. Sadly, the Adeline Carlson Mission Circle, after meeting under various names since 1938, decided their time of service had come to an end and voted to disband at the end of the year.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Unfortunately, Pastor Ernst Stutterheim became ill in October, 1997, and was unable to continue ministering at Delwood Road Baptist Church. Interim pastors and congregational members helped fill pulpit supply. Pastor Jeff Kilmartin was asked to fill in on a week to week basis and he accepted this. Two worship teams alternated weeks for our Sunday services. The church continued to struggle with finances and made use of one half of the GIC&#39;s ($6,000) and redeposited the other half. The Spanish Church continued to rent our site for their ministry needs.</font></p>

			<p><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">1998</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Jeff Kilmartin was hired to be an interim pastor for 15 hours a week starting February 1, 1998. Judi-Lynn and Matthew Pearce shared the Summer Temporary Employment Program (STEP) position to work over the summer of 1998. Sunday School was suspended for the summer but a &quot;Super church&quot; program was planed for July 12 and August 16<sup>th</sup> as a special feature for the children. DVBS ran in the evenings August 10-14, which appeared to work well for both volunteers and the children. Delwood Baptist Church have always run successful and fun-filled DVBS programs which have been well received in the neighbourhood and this year was no exception.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Tonnael Bardell took over the running of the preschool program, Jonah&#39;s Whale of a Preschool. The ladies of the church took on the responsibility to subsidize a needy preschool student so they could attend preschool. A Senior&#39;s Tea was organized in October, and we were treated to a special speaker and a children&#39;s hand bell presentation. This was advertised in the neighbourhood through door to door flyers. A Prayer Circle list was compiled and implemented so we could be praying for one another through the week when prayer needs arise. The Youth attended Y.C. in Red Deer. The church picnic was held at Borden Park which was enjoyed by all. The congregation continued to be strong supporters of the Christmas Shoe Box program. The church initiated the delivery of the Living Light News to the surrounding neighbourhood on behalf of our church. It is an excellent publication that advised the community what Christian events were happening in our city. Susan Laycock continued as our Worship Leader and blessed us with her musical and organizational abilities.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Programs continuing through 1998 were the Men&#39;s Bible Study on Monday nights, the Ladies Bible Study on Tuesday evenings at the church and the Ladies Breakfast meetings once a month (16 participants). We had a potluck supper together at the church on November 11<sup>th.</sup> Notable church upkeep included the installation of a new hot water tank and a bench being placed outside the entrance doors for people to sit while waiting for drivers, etc. The traditional Christmas banquet took place on December 11<sup>th</sup> and the Children&#39;s Christmas presentation on December 13<sup>th</sup>. There was a special Christmas service on December 20<sup>th</sup>. </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">We sadly received Pastor Jeff&#39;s resignation effective the end of January, 1999. He had accepted a full time pastoral position in Beausejour, Manitoba. Pastor Ernst Stutterheim had still been unable to return to work and it was decided that the congregation would have to consider his position with Delwood as completed. A search committee was formed to find a new Pastor for the church.</font></p>

			<p><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><b>1999</b></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Pastor Jeff&#39;s encouraged the congregation with words in his pastoral letter at our annual meeting in January, 1999.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">He wrote: &quot;The church has gone through some trying times in the past, and has kept together remarkably well - it has in fact grown in the process! This kind of unity does not come about by accident but by God working in each of us as the head directing the body. It shows that each individual has been willing to be a part of the larger community of Christ, allowing Him to increase while we decrease.&quot;</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">We were very sad that the Kilmartin&#39;s left our church but excited for their new ministry opportunities at their full time position in Manitoba. The congregation experienced great spiritual growth and guidance under Pastor Jeff&#39;s ministry.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">In February, 1999, it was unanimously agreed to hire Pastor Roy Nickel to be our part time pastor for 20 hours a week. The church sought information on how to receive funding from the Baptist Union to help us pay for a full time pastoral position. Discussion amongst Delwood members indicated that although we were struggling financially, we believed the church still had a viable ministry in the neighbourhood. We provided DVBS and play school outreach, and we were the only evangelical church in the area. Although we were not meeting our budget, we were spending much less than our budget called for and we were meeting our financial commitments.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Pastor Rick Hanson was hired as the STEP person for the summer this year and together with his wife, Rev. Darlene Hanson, organized the DVBS program which ministered to over 50 children. Wednesday night Family night was begun with Alpha in the church for the adults and Kids Klub in the portable for children up to grade 6. There were 15-20 children attending and good fun and strong biblical teaching were experienced by all participants.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Tonnae Bardell continued with the preschool ministry, and Becky Bartlett worked diligently to have Junior Church run successfully. The Senior&#39;s ministry continued at Northway Lodge under the leadership of the Scrantons. We continued to struggle financially but were meeting our commitments. We purchased a riding lawnmower so Doug Tebby, our exterior maintenance volunteer servant, wouldn&#39;t have to continue to walk the extensive grassy area on our property in cutting the grass. The furnaces were said to be 31+ years old but still working fine. Our account with the Baptist Union was $18,454.53 which can be accessed if necessary. We cashed the last of our GIC&#39;s to meet our expenses.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Special events at the church included an Edmonton-based worship band, Patrick&#39;s Hill, who blessed the congregation with their worship, while another night Barnabas Players from Prairie Bible College presented a faith challenging drama. Our Christmas Banquet presented us with the opportunity to have missionaries, Gladys and Tom Donelon share what God was doing in Turkey. A silent auction helped raise funds for the church in Turkey. At the Christmas Eve service the children and youth performed a nativity skit. There were two baptisms in 1999 and several new decisions for Christ.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">In June, an induction service was held for the Nickel family which was a blessing to all involved. Throughout the year, we continued with our traditional Good Friday breakfast, and our Seniors Tea saw double the attendance than at last year&#39;s tea. The ABC&#39;s of Natural Church Development was studied by the Deacons and wives at the pastor&#39;s home during the year. The youth group attended Y.C. in Red Deer and had a Spaghetti Supper fundraiser to help them on their way.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">We were sorry to see Susan Laycock, our music director for two years, leave the church to move to a church closer to her home. She was greatly appreciated and loved by our congregation.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">In November, 1999, the deacons requested $24,000 from the Baptist Union for Salary Aid to help us hire Roy as our full time pastor.</font></p>

			<p><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><b>2000</b></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Salary Aid from the Baptist Union was approved and Roy Nickel was hired full time effective March 1, 2000. $2100.00 was borrowed from the building fund to pay for legal costs concerning Ernst Stutterheim&#39;s settlement.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">14 people were baptized this year. Programs running this year were the Alpha Program, video Heaven&#39;s Gates, Hell&#39;s Flames, Gayle Erwin video series on the Nature and Character of God, Kids Klub, Two Weigh Down Workshops, Worship workshop, &quot;Dare to Dream&quot; Day to look at future direction of the church, Inventory of Spiritual gifts in the church. Stewardship Awareness Month was promoted in April. The Deacons, pastor and wives took a course on &quot;Jesus in Servant-hood&quot;, which was a leadership development course, as well as participating in a L.I.F.E. group - Henry Blackaby&#39;s &quot;Experiencing God&quot;. Sunday School was re-established for adults and Kids Church (grades 1-6) extended to run from 10:30 - 12:30. Teens worked with leaders Joyce Nickel and Judy Pearce to run games, puppet shows, skits, etc. The teens attended a meeting each week to practice and prepare for their leadership role on Sundays. Tonnae Bardell ran the Kids Church Program for the younger children. The Alpha group continued to meet mid-week at the Scrantons.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">A very successful Christmas banquet saw the ministry of the &quot;Twins plus One&quot; bless each participant.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">There was remarkable growth in the lives of many individuals which is the most encouraging sign of growing health and strength.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Women&#39;s Group had breakfasts once a month and participated in outreach activities, There was some emphasis on Missions at the breakfasts and 12-14 people were involved.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">It was exciting to witness 14 baptisms this year (5 adults and 9 children). Six adults were received into membership(5 by baptism and 1 by application).</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Kids Club was very successful with 25-30 children in attendance on a regular basis. Nicole Clark was hired as the Step Student for the summer and was the primary force behind the successful VBS program. The wrap up meeting saw 120 in attendance.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Jonah&#39;s Whale of a Preschool continued to be a positive witness in the neighbourhood serving preschool children and their families on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons and Wednesday mornings. The preschool was advertised as a Christian preschool owned and operated by Delwood Road Baptist Church. Enrolled in the school were 19 children from 15 families. 6 families were born again believers, 4 families identified themselves as Catholic and 5 families were non believers (of which 3 were from Lebanese backgrounds).</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Norway Lodge moved to a new facility in the Rosslyn area. Scrantons continued to minister to over 20-25 seniors at the Rosslyn Lodge once a month.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Church attendance dropped of in April and did not recover until August. Giving lagged behind last year. Several families who had been consistent attenders moved to other churches as their lives/jobs/residences changed. Transfer of membership was made for Leo and Jennie Popadoloulous to Beulah Alliance Church.</font></p>

			<p><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><b>2001</b></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">In February, 2001, Pastor Roy Nickel suffered from a head concussion and various guest speakers filled the pulpit while he was off work. The leadership organizational style reverted back to the &#39;Commissions&#39; format where there was a deacon heading up Christian Education, Congregational Needs, Outreach, Stewardship and a new Worship Ministry Commission. During the Pastor&#39;s vacation, we viewed a four week video series entitled &quot;Out of the Salt Shaker and into the World&quot; by Rebecca Pippert which was challenging and inspiring.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">The church continued to struggle financially. The STEP position application for 2001 was approved by the government but the costs over and above the program could not be covered by the church so the position was not filled. This meant there was no summer student hired this year which left a void in organizing DVBS for the neighbourhood. We were blessed to have volunteers from Sherwood Park Baptist Church come to the church to run a Children&#39;s Day Camp at the church over the summer. There were approximately forty children attending this program and by all reports, it was enjoyed by all.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Tonnae finished up with Jonah&#39;s Whale of a Preschool because she had accepted an employment opportunity elsewhere. The graduation ceremony for the children transformed the sanctuary into &quot;Heaven, Kids of the King&quot;. We are sorry that this ministry to our community has come to an end. Tonnae did a wonderful job with the children and with the parents.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Re-application for continued salary aid was made to the Baptist Union. It was decided to reduce our requested aid from the Baptist Union by 10% as a sign of faith and challenge to us, and to ease the stretch on Baptist Union resources. We request $1800 instead of $2000.00 but the Baptist Union reduced the salary aid to $1500.00 a month beginning January 1, 2002.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">This again, raised the issue of the future of Delwood Road Baptist Church. We had been told Highlands Baptist Church wanted to do a church plant in Clareview and we wondered if they use our building to start here? We discussed campus churches, such as those who had 2 pastors between 3 congregations. We discussed accessing our building fund money to pay for a Pastor if needed. After discussion, the church guaranteed Roy full time to June 30, 2002. The congregation agreed we would withdraw $500 a month toward Roy&#39;s salary for the next six months, if need be.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">The church worked through &quot;Natural Church Development&quot; with Rev. Ed Dyck. The Deacons and pastor attended a Deacons&#39; Retreat and worked on a new Missions Statement and discussed strategy for the future of Delwood. Robert Wyse joined Blair Scranton and Bob Pearce on the Deacon&#39;s Board. The Deacons and pastor worked through a revised mission statement. &quot;We are to be a community of believers committed to making disciples who Reach Up to God in worship, who Reach In to each other in fellowship, and Reach Out to the world in love with the Gospel of Peace.&quot;</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">The Baptist Union Credentials Committee and the Ordination Examination Council recommended that Delwood Road Baptist Church ordain Pastor Roy Nickel and this occurred in June 2001. It was a wonderful festive event when the church celebrated Roy&#39;s success and calling with many of his friends and colleagues.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">In the first half of 2001, a program called Kids Klub was run during the Junior Church and Sunday School time period for grades one to six. In the second half of 2001, Junior Church consisted of learning about how the Bible was put together, memorizing the books of the Bible and doing Sword Drill. The last 15 minutes was spent in hearing the mis-adventures of Charlie Sunday School, a grade 3 or 4 Christian boy who always wanted to do what God wanted him to do. Sunday School concentrated on Pilgrim&#39;s Progress and the lessons learned from the Christian Journey. When there became a need for a teacher for younger children, Valerie Scranton accepted the responsibility for guiding their spiritual learning and Robert Wyse took on teaching the Youth. The teens stepped in to take care of the under grade one&#39;s when childcare was needed to allow parents to hear the sermon.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Weekly Family nights were an enjoyable and bonding activity for church members with video nights, potluck suppers, talent nights and theme evenings. Alpha continued to meet on Wednesday nights at the church. The teens met with the Braemar Youth on Saturdays. There was a fundraiser at the church to help 9 teens attend YC 2001. The two worship teams combined into one and ministered each week rather than alternating weeks. Outreach to Seniors continued with the Scrantons. Women&#39;s breakfast continued to meet monthly on a Saturday morning. A Secret Sisters program was organized. The women&#39;s retreat through the Baptist Union was attended by some of the ladies. Mid week bible studies occurred at the Pastor&#39;s home. Our Sunday School picnic was held at Borden Park. Outreach activities including inviting friends to such activities as our perogy night and talent night. Zennie Bruce looked after the flower beds and make sure the outside of the church looked welcoming and beautiful. Blair Scranton made sure the grass was cut and many others worked on the inside of the building to do some decorating such as painting the kitchen.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">We mourned the passing of our dear friend and faithful servant, Kathleen Phillips, who passed away in March. She had been one of the founding members of our church.</font></p>

			<p><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><b>2002</b></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Letter of transfer was sent to Southminster United Church for Kath Ross and Becky Barlett as they are now worshipping there. Murray and Deborah Jackshaw transferred to Steele Heights Baptist Church. Joan Collison moved to Calgary and Joanne McGow moved to B.C. The Wyse family moved to Steele Heights Baptist Church where they could attend Saturday services each week and where their boys could attend youth activities. Donnell&#39;s work was only allowing her to attend every second Sunday at Delwood.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">We mourned with those who had family members die and prayed for our elderly who were shut ins and those struggling with illness. We remembered our congregational members who were faithful servants but who no longer worshipped with us, either through death or through illness. Notably we remembered Ethel Steel, Peggy Scarlett, Don McGow, Elgar Roberts, Margaret Bowles, Eli Strychun, Doug and Dorothy Thomson, Jim and Esther Warner, and Pauline Yarolslowsky.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Pastor Roy Nickel felt led to resign from his position at Delwood Road Baptist Church to be effective at the end of September 30, 2002. At a congregational meeting with Sam Breakey in August 26, 2002, the congregation wrestled with the future of Delwood Road Baptist Church. Finances were difficult and leadership was tired. We could close the doors, share a pastor with another church or hire a part time pastor. We were advised that Highlands Baptist Church contacted Sam Breakey to let them know that they were offering to help Delwood Road in any way they could. There was still optimism that God could revive our little church to be a real presence in the community.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">As we prayed and sought God&#39;s will, we had various people come to the church as pulpit supply. One of those people was Rev. Keith Bienert who spent all of October, 2002 with us. We voted to ask Rev. Keith Bienert to serve as our interim pastor until July, 2003 as we continued to pray about God&#39;s wisdom for direction for Delwood. Pastor Keith joined us as our part time pastor on November 10, 2002. Pastor Keith blessed us, built us up and encouraged us with his steady faith and his close walk with the Lord. His wife, Lilyane, also blessed us and we came to love this couple dearly. Keith and Lilyane joined the worship team. Lilyane was the main pianist with Valerie Scranton as back up. Janie Fredericks and Tonnae Bardell were vocalists along with Rick Fredericks and Lilyane. Rick, Pastor Keith and Theo played the guitars. The worship team led in a combination of hymns and choruses reflecting the theme of the sermon.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">On December 6, 2002, We enjoyed a wonderful Christmas banquet with 83 people who were treated to &quot;an Old Fashioned Christmas&quot; with the Bienerts providing entertainment and snippets of their thoughts about Christmas in Brazil.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Maintenance of note through this year was the installation of two new furnaces. These were installed for no cost by a relative of a congregational member. God is good. A new Church Directory was developed with updated phone numbers and addresses. The kitchen was rented to a woman from the community who was doing a type of &quot;meals on wheels&quot; service for seniors. The Spanish Church, which had been meeting at the Delwood Site since 1989, continued to meet in the building. Activities through the year included a potluck meal at which we were able to hear from missionary, Heather Smith. Ladies breakfasts were held on Saturday morning as a time of fellowship and the annual Christmas party for Ladies was held. We were excited to see Connie Matthews attend as she had been ill and housebound for a long time previously. Our VBS Program, August 12-16 saw 35 children attending and 17 of those making a commitment to follow Christ. Hallelujah! The Scrantons ministered at the monthly services at Rosslyn Place. Tonnae Bardell took over the sending of cards to people when needed.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Theo Klymok started a coffee house gospel rock ministry (the ARK) and has seen up to 100 young people attend. Jamie Pearce gave up his job of cleaning the church after years of working that position and Mary Rud took over the task. Weekly bulletins and prayer and praise sheets to take home for reminders were implemented to the worship service.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">We started our first Prayer and Praise meeting which was well received. We were enjoying our monthly potluck meetings together. We saw an increase in attendance in the children&#39;s programs. We re-introduced our greeter&#39;s ministry. We increased Pastor Keith&#39;s hours from 20 to 25. A Youth Ministry Team (SERVE) from B.C. painted the Portable and front entrance to the church as a service to Delwood July 19-25. Pastor Keith spoke at Gull Lake Family Camp August 1-4<sup>th.</sup></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Through our prayers and discussions over the first six months of 2003, we were still seeking God&#39;s direction for the church. We questioned the viability of staying open with only 15 to 20 people committed to attendance. We were stretched for finances, leadership, youth activities and energy. We talked about selling the church property and had an appraisal done. (The appraisal of the Delwood church and land was valued at $350,000 - $400,000.) We talked about renting the church to another entity. Clareview Evangelical Free Church was meeting in a school and had expressed interest in renting. A Portuguese Church was interested in renting the building until the end of summer with a view to possible purchase. The Spanish Church continued to rent our building for $315.00 a month but were not in a position to look at purchasing the site.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">It was discussed that Highlands Baptist Church might be hiring a new pastor in January 2004 and they would be looking at a church plant at that time. Perhaps they could look at a work at Delwood. It was decided that we would attend Highlands for the summer and extend Pastor Keith&#39;s employment with us until the end of August. We would have a service at Delwood July 13 and another one on August 31<sup>st.</sup> Several members also visited Clareview Evangelical Free Church to connect with them in case it worked out that they would rent/buy our facilities in the future.</font></p>

			<p><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">August 13, 2003 discussion paper indicated Options discussed with the congregation.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">A. Amalgamate and become a campus of Highlands. Highlands would be responsible for ministry and for maintenance of the property. Delwood would be represented on the Highland&#39;s board. Ownership of the property would have to be discussed. </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">B. Rent or lease the Building to the Claireview Evangelical Church. The property would be administered by Highlands who would receive the rent and maintain the building.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">C. Seek to sell the church to an evangelical church with the funds going to the Baptist Union.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Eighteen regular attenders present plus 2 visitors.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">It was reported that the Spanish Church had disbanded. The Portuguese Church sent a letter indicating their interest in buying our facility.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Pastor Howard Lawrence, from Highlands Baptist Church, indicated his willingness to answer any questions regarding possible partnership with Highlands.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">It was decided that Delwood would extend Pastor Keith&#39;s position until the end of September. During this time he would preach 3 times in September and also investigate integration or partnership with Highlands. The Delwood congregation would meet at Delwood and study the scrolls. There would be no children&#39;s Sunday School during September and families with children were encouraged to attend Highlands during this time of working out how Highlands and Delwood could join together. We wanted to work together with Highlands to promote the Connecting Church model. There was to be a meeting October 5<sup>th</sup> following a potluck lunch to discuss where we would go from there. Pastor Keith expressed his feelings that the Highlands Board was feeling overwhelmed with the idea of amalgamating and were not ready to move this quickly without further information and discussion.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">At the end of September, Pastor Keith let Delwood know that they were accepting a ministry position at South Edmonton Alliance Church and October 5<sup>th</sup> would be his last day with us. He advised us that Highlands was asking us to consider: </font></p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">participate in weekly home groups in the community.<br />
			Join with Highlands for worship and Sunday School for a period of 3 months to a year.<br />
			Worship services will continue at Highlands until there would be enough people and leadership in the north group to have a worship service at Delwood.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Some of those present at the meeting were Pastor Keith, Delwood Road Baptist Church, Pastor Howard Lawrence, Highlands Baptist Church, and Sam Breakey of the Baptist Union. Also present were Blair and Valerie Scranton, Janie Fredericks, Walter and Martha Nicholson, Bob and Judy Pearce, Daniel Dent and visitors from Highlands, George Traynor, and Al Loosley</font></p>

			<p><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><b>Motions at the October 5, 2003 meeting that were passed.</b></font></p>

			<p><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Motion #1 - To merge the ministry of Delwood Road Baptist Church with the ministry of Highlands Baptist Church. This ministry will be led by Highlands Baptist Church on approval of Highlands Congregation Membership.</font></p>

			<p><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Motion #2 - We move that the Delwood Baptist Church property and building be transferred to the Baptist Union and held in trust for five (5) years. At that point, the property would be released to Highlands Baptist Church upon the establishment of a viable congregation and ministry in the community.</font></p>

			<p><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Motion #3 - The Delwood Building Fund monies (around $8,000-$10,000) will be available to Highlands Baptist Church for the maintenance of the Delwood buildings and property.</font></p>

			<p><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Motion #4 - Motion to dissolve Delwood Road Baptist Church Society on December 31, 2003. (Pastor Keith clarified that the Baptist Union wants us to dissolve on December 31 for legal purposes for Revenue Canada).</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Special thanks were given to long time servants within the Delwood congregation - Martha Nicholson and Stan Clark for their faithfulness in taking care of the books and the money, cheques, etc., Blair Scranton and Bob Pearce for years of service on the Deacon&#39;s Board and to their wives for their sacrifices on behalf of the church.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Through the history of Delton Baptist Church/Delwood Road Baptist Church starting in 1922 and existing until 2003, we have seen many, many faithful believers within our congregation who have stayed, learned, taught, encouraged and who have then gone out into the world to minister to others. So many people have touched one another&#39;s lives within our walls, helping each other become more Christ like. We now move forward as brothers and sisters in Christ, joining with Highlands Baptist Church (to later come under the umbrella of the Neighbourhood Church) to continue to make an impact on our world and continuing to be faithful to our Lord Jesus Christ.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><i>Every time I think of you, I give thanks to my God. I always pray for you, and I make my requests with a heart full of joy because you have been my partners in spreading the Good News about Christ from the time you first heard it until now. And I am sure that God, who began the good work within you, will continue his work until it is finally finished on that day when Christ Jesus comes back again. Philippians 1:1-6</i></font></p>
