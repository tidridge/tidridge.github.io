			<p pbzloc="10" style="text-align: left"><br />
			<span pbzloc="19" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Sorry it has taken so long to get back to you. As you may know the lawn bowling club is celebrating 100 years of lawn bowling in Highlands this year [2018]. Although the green has been at its current location since 1921, the club has in the past I think hung its hat on a photo from the Magrath mansion dated 1918 which resides in the Glenbow Archives. &nbsp;The photo depicts a group of men &ldquo;lawn bowling&rdquo; (although they are mostly posing for the pic) and there is a trophy in the shot - indicating some level of organization. </span></p>

			<p pbzloc="10" style="text-align: left"><span pbzloc="20" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">You can probably tell from my tap dancing around here that solid documentation is scarce for neighbourhood clubs like ours. That said, the older logo for the club has for many years boasted EST. 1918. To get the Magrath photo I think you would have to deal directly with the Glenbow. We have the image for use this year but they are very sticky about payment and licensing.</span></p>

			<p pbzloc="5" style="text-align: left"><br />
			<span pbzloc="21" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The city archives have a few plaques that indicate tournaments through the 30s and 40s and the club was recently donated a plaque that includes results from the early 30s. The club has gone through several iterations and slight variations in names over the decades, depending on provincial non-profit registration rules and various types of incorporation as well as its involvement with the provincial lawn bowling bodies over the years.</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p pbzloc="10" style="text-align: left"><span pbzloc="22" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">We have some photos from earlier days - We are in the midst of bringing some of those together. I would have to check with other members of the club executive but could likely rustle a couple up for you once we get past the July 1 weekend which is a particularly busy one for the club.</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p pbzloc="10" style="text-align: left"><span pbzloc="23" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Here&rsquo;s a pocket history we have from earlier club descriptions and some research a couple of us did at the city archives: Situated in the leafy Highlands neighbourhood, the Highlands Lawn Bowling Club welcomes people of all ages and abilities from all over the city of Edmonton.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Lawn bowling has a long history in the Highlands. A photo from 1918 depicts a happy group of lawn bowlers on William Magrath&rsquo;s lawn on Ada Boulevard. Magrath was co-owner of the Magrath-Holgate &amp; Co. Ltd., the developer and builder of the Highlands subdivision in the early 20th&nbsp;century. His mansion, built in 1912, still stands. Magrath was an avid sportsman, with particular interest in lawn bowling, curling and baseball.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: left"><span pbzloc="13" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">&nbsp;In 1921, the bowling green and a baseball diamond were built in the park area at 62 St. and 113 Ave. In the 1950s a clubhouse was built with changing rooms for skating and hockey, a member&rsquo;s lounge and space for the lawn bowling club. The Highlands Lawn Bowling Association was created in 1957.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: left"><span pbzloc="14" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The Lawn Bowling Club received a certificate of incorporation under the Societies Act on July 15, 1993, enabling the club to apply for grants for renovations. The greens were renewed and refurbished in 2002.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: left"><span pbzloc="15" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">In 2018, the club will celebrate 100 years of lawn bowling in Highlands.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: left"><span pbzloc="16" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The club today has members from ten years old and up. Lawn bowling is truly a sport for a lifetime. The club has an array of bowls for use by members. We have coaching for new members and for members wanting to perfect their skills. The club hosts special events and tournaments throughout the season which runs from mid-May to late September.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: left"><span pbzloc="17" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Out of town bowlers are welcome to pop by for a game for $5.</span></p>

			<p pbzloc="6" style="text-align: left"><span pbzloc="18" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Highlands is a great club full of friendly members. Come out and participate!</span></p>
