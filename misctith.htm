			<p style="text-align: justify"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">The earliest record we have found is a record of <b>Ricardus Tytheryge</b> marring <b>Als Hall</b> at Winchester St. Maurice in 1539.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">We have also found a will written in Old English from May 5, 1542 of <b>Richarde Tetridge</b> of the parish of Chilcombe, Winchester. He leaves goods and his property in Avington to his mother <b>Alys</b>, his wife <b>Margery</b>, his son <b>Wylliam</b> and Margery&#39;s unborn child. </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">There is also a strange entry in the 1922 IGI <b>&quot;Tetridge Alys Mrs</b> FS 05 May 1542 Chilcombe of&quot; F= birth of first known child S=? (possibly stillborn) The entry does not come from the Chilcombe parish records, and its origin remains a mystery.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><font color="#000000" face="arial" pbzloc="63" size="3">The exact connection between these three records is unclear although one would have to speculate there is on Richard with wife Alys, but why the wife is definitely called Margery in the will is strange and unexplained</font></p>

			<p pbzloc="82" style="text-align: justify"><font color="#000000" face="arial" pbzloc="69" size="3">In the 17 th century an increased number of records with various spellings of the surname begin to appear. This shows the families enlarging and spreading throughout the small villages around Winchester. Unfortunately, most of these records from different villages cannot be connected to each other, although it is tempting to make some speculations. There are numerous parish records not covered by the IGI, but time has only permitted us to search a small number of the Hampshire parish records. This leaves many parishes we have not investigated at all, and it may be that there are lots of important Titheridge records just waiting to be discovered.<br />
			It should be remembered that some church records do not begin until the end of the century and large numbers of births, marriages and burials may have gone unrecorded and be lost</font></p>

It appears to be the central tree from which many of the other branches of Titheridges are descended. IN addition to this central tree, we have found four other family trees that we had originally drawn up as trees in their own right, which we have now discovered are begun by the individuals who were born in Cheriton and are descendants of <b>John</b> and <b>Anne</b>. Unfortunately we do not have a piece of paper large enough to construct one giant tree for all these individuals! Altogether this gives us 368+ known descendants of John and Anne of Cheriton covering 12 generations and stretching up to the present day.<br />
			We feel sure that several more groups will eventually join on top this tree, once we can find the right pieces of information to make the connection.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><b pbzloc="219">THE TITHERIDGE HISTORY 18TH CENTURY.</b></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">In the eighteenth century numerous other new family groups appeared in Hampshire, some of the most important ones, or the ones we know most about, are listed below. Many cannot be connected to earlier families. </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">In 1728 the Titheridges started to populate New Alresford. In 1737 <b>William</b> and <b>Sarah</b> had the first of their nine children baptised. Between 1737 and 1812 there were about 30 Titheridges born, but due to the uninformative nature of the early records, it has proved impossible to connect these individuals and families to other family groups and trees, except by speculation.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">In 1744 <b>Daniel and Rebecca Baker</b> marry in Portsea St. Mary. It is the descendants of this couple who all spell their name Titheradge, producing one of the variations of the surname that survives today.<br />
			All the Titheradges that we know of are descended from Daniel and Rebecca, with the exception of one family group in Australia who are descended from Frederick mentioned above. Unfortunately we do not know where Daniel was born or anything about him. We would like to speculate that he came from Kilmeston and hence is a descendant from Cheriton, but we have no evidence at all for this , except that there is a Daniel of the right age born in Kilmeston. At present we are at a loss as how to prove or disprove this theory or how to discover his origins.<br />
			Hence our own direct family line remains stuck in Portsea in 1744, which is frustrating when we have made such progress with other branches of the family.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">In 1761 <b>William</b> married <b>Ann Cranston</b> in Old Alresford. Their son, <b>William</b> produced a family of 7 children in New Alresford between 1784 and 1794 when William died. Whether he died of natural causes as suggested by the inquest report in the paper, or whether he was murdered by a neighbour, as later suggested by his son <b>Richard</b>, remains unknown.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">The eldest child <b>Robert</b>, born in 1784, is possibly, the same Robert who married <b>Lucy Ann Holdup</b> in Gosport in 1808. One of their children, <b>William Henry Walter</b>, moved to London sometime prior to 1845 where he died a very wealthy gentlemen in 1886 leaving his descendants the considerable sum of 6189 (pounds sterling) in his will. He spelt his name <b>Tytheridge</b> as did all his descendants, so producing one of the two family groups who spell their surname Tytheridge. (We do not know how the other family of Tytheridges started other than they appeared in the London area around 1856 and then in Woolwich from 1878) </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">William and Ann&#39;s third son, <b>Richard Cranston (b 1788)</b> is perhaps the most colourful character amongst our ancestors and the one we know most about.<br />
			Our interest in this individual was attracted by a booklet in the Winchester Record Office entitled &quot;Dickey Dung Prong or Richard Titheridge of New Alresford&quot;. The booklet is written by a minister who converted this rogue to Christianity shortly before he died in 1834 in Southampton.<br />
			Richard had a long list of sins to repent. He had been court martialled for deserting the army and for attempting murder, by attacking him with a dung fork, a soldier who tried to arrest him. This incident gave him his nick name. He had also been sentenced to imprisonment, transportation, flogging etc.<br />
			Among his list of crimes were theft, drunkenness, fornication and profound swearing. The booklet is fascinating to read but the story is obviously a little over dramatised for effect, although we have been able to substantiate some of the facts.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">In 1768 the first Titheridges in Southampton are recorded, when <b>John</b> marries <b>Mary Tucker</b> at Southampton, St. Mary. They lived at Itchen Ferry with their family. John died a mariner who left a considerable amount of money and property (six houses) when he died in 1825. We do not know from where John came but it is possible that he came from Portsea.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Other small unconnected groups appear in other villages such are Farnham and Medstead.</font></p>

The number of children in the family has decreased throughout the century and certainly up to 1948 there is a reduction of births compared with the end of the nineteenth century. Also in many family lines the name of Titheridge is dying out due to the number of girls born.</font></p>
