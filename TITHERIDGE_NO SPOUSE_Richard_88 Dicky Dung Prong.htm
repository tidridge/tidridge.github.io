Adv. 1835)</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><b>NARRATIVE, etc.</b></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><b>Richard TITHERIDGE</b>, the subject of the following pages, was born at New Alresford, in the County of Hants. his parents, it appears, were strangers to religion themselves, and brought up their children with careless indifference respecting the salvation of their souls. &quot;When I was a lad,&quot; says Richard, &quot;I was generally idle with idle and vicious lads like myself: I seldom entered a place of public worship, and very early learnt to swear, and to take God&#39;s holy name in vain; was afterwards guilty of robbing orchards, and committing other depredations of similar kind; and though repeatedly detected and severely punished, I never forsook my evil practices. I was sent to school, but refused to learn to even read.&quot;</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">When he was about fourteen years of age, he lost his father, (<b>William Titheridge</b>) by trade a tailor, had occasion to go to Winchester on business; not returning at night as was expected, the family were greatly alarmed. On the following morning, about four o&#39;clock, the guard of the mail coach, passing through Alresford to Winchester, discovered a man, apparently lifeless, lying close to the garden palings of the Mattingley farm, about half mile from the Mattingley turnpike gate, and three and one half miles from Alresford. He instantly aroused the inmates of the farm (by blowing his horn) who, on getting up, discovered it to be Titheridge, some say with his throat cut, others (elderly persons) living in the neighbourhood of Alresford, that his throat was not cut, but that marks of violence were found on his neck, which led to a conclusion that he was strangled etc. </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">The melancholy news soon reached the already half-distracted wife, and the body was removed home in a cart. The jury, after a patient enquiry, returned a verdict of wilful murder against some person or persons unknown. It however appears, that some suspicion rested on a person in the neighbourhood: he was taken up and examined, but no evidence appearing against him, he was dismissed. </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">This horrid murder was committed about sixty two years ago; but He who has said,&quot; Be sure your sin will find you out,&quot; permitted the whole affair to be brought to light in the following manner:- About two years ago the wife of the person alluded to was taken very ill, and being greatly distressed in her mind, confessed that it was her husband who had murdered Titheridge, [her husband has been dead some years.] It appears according to her account, (so I am informed by those who read the account in the public newspapers that Titheridge overtook her on her road home, on his return from Winchester, and they walked in company together; her husband came to meet her: Titheridge had occasion to stay behind, and she and her husband went towards home. He, however, returned to meet Titheridge, quarrelled with him for being in company with her, and then cut his throat! I leave the reader to make his own reflections upon this awful circumstance for the present *[1].</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">By this heavy affliction, Titheridge&#39;s family were plunged into overwhelming distress, and were obliged to go into the workhouse. Richard, however resolved (and I believe another brother also) to maintain himself, and obtained employment in a stable; sometimes as errand boy to a butcher, and other times breaking in horses, etc., at which he was remarkably clever, so much so, that it has been said no one could excel him in that business. He has been known to stand on the back of a horse while at full speed, carrying a basket of meat on his arm; and though he was a venturesome and daring youth, it does not appear that he ever met with any serious accident; he also acted as postilion to Collyer&#39;s coach for some time. After this he came to Southampton, and engaged himself as a servant at the Dolphin tap.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">About this period he enlisted into a regiment of Light Dragoons, then in camp at Netley, with several other regiments, amounting in all to about forty thousand men, who soon embarked at Southampton quay for Holland. Being very expert horseman, he was employed as rough rider to the regiment to which he belonged. After being engaged in several actions in Holland his regiment was ordered into Portugal; here he was engaged in several actions and skirmishes, and as can be easily conceived, was often in imminent danger.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">One circumstances of extreme peril he related to me as follows:- he was fighting sword in hand with a very expert French soldier, from whom he received a severe wound, which bled profusely; he felt himself getting weak, and expected nothing but to be killed; he however fought on, when an unexpected opportunity presenting itself, he thrust his sword into the mouth of his antagonist; he fell, and Richard immediately retreated to have his wound dressed.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">It my be well here to pause, and to enquire what Richard&#39;s character was now he had arrived to manhood, and more particularly while in the army; to this it must be answered, his riper years were in perfect unison with his boyhood, with this exception, that his bad habits grew with his growth, and strengthened with his strength. He was notorious for every vice: in drunkenness, fornication, and profane swearing, he exceeded most bad men; to which we must add, he was a great SCOFFER AT RELIGION. To hear him confess his wicked conduct, and the sufferings he had to endure in consequence thereof, has made my heart ache many times. For the crime of drunkenness, theft etc. He has been flogged, dungeoned, and drilled repeatedly. At one time he received three hundred lashes, and, to use his own expression, was almost cut to pieces. </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Once or more he was picketed, a punishment at which the human mind must even shudder. As some who read this may not know the nature of the punishment, I will endeavour to explain it. The offender is fastened by a rope round the right wrist to a branch of a tree or beam, the left hand is tied behind him; and in this state he hangs his whole weight upon his wrist, with the exception of having a pointed piece of wood under one foot, barely high enough to rest upon, to ease the wrist a little - this punishment last for an hour. Richard, speaking of it says no one can conceive the misery endured but those who have gone through it. I inquired for what offence he had received this punishment? He replied, he had been guilty of some fault and refused to humble himself to his officer. &quot;Ah!&quot; said he,&quot; I have often cursed those who condemned me, but would never stoop to ask pardon at their hands.&quot; An awful proof of the hardness and obstinacy of his wicked heart.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">&quot;Ah, Richard&quot;, said I to him one day, &quot;the way of transgressors is hard&quot;. &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said he, &quot;it is, I have found it so all my life long. Happy would it have been for me if I had listened to the advice of my Mother. Hear this, you that make mock at a kind Mother&#39;s advice. &quot;Her words&quot;, added he, &quot;often came across my mind, and made me wish I was a better fellow&quot;. It may be right to add, he always spoke very feelingly of her, and I have been informed that he occasionally sent her a trifle; a trifle we may easily suppose it must be, as drunkenness, and other vices in which he indulged, are of too expensive a nature to allow much for poor broken-hearted Mother; it should however encourage Pious Mothers to persevere in seeking, by good advice and earnestness in prayer, the salvation of their ungodly children.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">To return to Richard&#39;s history. After an absence of seventeen years, the regiment, or rather the skeleton of it was ordered home; for out of the nine hundred and twenty five who went out with him, only seventeen returned! May the time soon arrive when nations shall learn war NO MORE. The regiment landed in the north of Ireland; but here we discover Richard to be the same hardened desperado as ever. Neither providential escapes nor sufferings ever produced any change in his conduct.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">While here, he arose at midnight, took his Calvary horse from the stable, padded its feet to prevent a noise till he had escaped the sentinel, rode off with it to Dublin, where he sold it with its accoutrements. Here he fell in with a drover, who was coming to England with a great quantity of pigs, and engaged to assist him on condition of his paying his fare to Liverpool. When he arrived, he made his way to Bristol, Winchester, and lastly to Windsor, where he obtained employment as helper in a stable. After remaining here some time, a soldier received information that he was a deserter, and entered the premises with the view to arrest him. Richard defended himself with a dung prong, which he stuck into the back of the soldier, and obliged him to fly; {it was from this circumstance he was nicknamed <b>DICKEY DUNG PRONG</b>}. After defeating the soldier he made his escape through a window, got over a garden wall belonging to a boarding school, and made his escape to Egham, where he was overtaken and brought back to Windsor, examined, and sent to Ireland: here he was tried by a court-martial and sentenced to be shot . He was then taken back to England to await the execution of his sentence, his coffin being placed in his cell with him [2]</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">A gentleman who visited him a week or so before the time appointed for his execution, asked Richard if he had ever rendered any important service to his King and country while abroad in the army, which would be likely to procure a commutation of his sentence? He said there was but one act, which he related as follows:- During an action, an aid-de-camp had his horse shot under him, and was thus placed in the most imminent danger of his life, and unable to convey his despatches, which were very important, to their proper quarters; he applied to several privates to dismount, but they refused. Richard however dismounted, and gave up his horse to him. Richard then retreated into a field, seized a horse that had lost its rider, then galloped into the ranks again. This proves him to have had some good qualities; and it is but just to say, that with all his wickedness, it does not appear he was ever of a cruel or unkind disposition.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">The gentlemen immediately wrote to the aid-de-camp, and to his honour be it spoken, he used immediate exertion to get the case laid before His Majesty, blaming Richard for not informing of his situation before. The day appointed arrived; he was ordered out for execution, which was to take place some distance from his place of confinement. A cart was provided to carry him and his coffin to the fatal spot; here again he manifested the stubbornness of his disposition by refusing to ride in the cart, and insisting upon walking to the place: this was permitted. Having reached the destined spot, and all arrangements being ready, he stood at the end of the coffin, awaiting the awful moment that would launch him into eternity; when behold! instead of receiving the fatal shot, an officer hastily rode up,*[3] and addressing himself to Richard, said, &quot;Titheridge, you once were the means of saving my life, and I have the pleasure of presenting you a free pardon from His Majesty! which he has been pleased to grant you in consideration of your kindness to me. This act of royal clemency is another star in the character of our ever-beloved sovereign, George the Third by whom the pardon was granted&quot;.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">On looking over the adventurous and wicked life of Richard up to this period in his history, we clearly discover what the human heart is capable of if left to itself; we also see how willing a servant to the devil that Richard was. Let us imagine him standing in awful suspense, awaiting the bullet, and let the following texts sink deep into our minds: &quot;The wages of sin is death!&quot; The wicked shall not live our half their days.&quot;</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">From the circumstances of his being thus almost miraculously snatched as it were from the jaws of death, and once more thrown back into life, the ready will be quick to conclude, &quot; Now we will hear of his becoming an altered character;&quot; would to God it had been so! But the following facts will speak for themselves.<br />
			Being dismissed from all connexion with the army, he returned home to see his mother at Alresford, who was rejoiced to see him after so narrow an escape from death; she begged him over and over again to become a different character; poor woman!<br />
			&#39;tis to be feared she knew but little that the only way of living a new life is to seek the grace of a new heart. It will however soon be seen, that while a man&#39;s heart remains unchanged by divine grace, neither mercies nor judgements produce any lasting change.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">While at Alresford he was convicted of theft, and sentenced to three months imprisonment, and to be whipped thought the streets at the cart&#39;s tail.*[4] At another time he was detected stealing cheese out of a wagon at Magdalen Hill fair, near Winchester; for this offence he was tried, found guilty, and sentenced to seven years transportation. He served five and was forgiven the remaining two. He was also imprisoned in Southampton Bridewell a few years ago.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">How truly is that text of sacred writ made out in Richard&#39;s history, &quot;because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the hearts of the sons of men are fully set in them to do evil.&quot; See Eccles. viii.11</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">I will mention another sinful act of his life, not because what has been said is insufficient to give a right view of his character, but because I hope it will prove a warning to others. Whilst at Alresford he seduced a young woman under promise of marriage. She fearing that he would not perform his promise, requested friends to speak to him on the subject; upon which he agreed to have the banns published. The day fixed for the wedding arrived; he went with her to the church, but upon some pretence stepped out again, and instead of returning made the best of his way to Southampton, leaving the injured woman and her friends to mourn her sad disgrace. Oh, that young women were wise, and remember, that he who is vile enough to seduce, will generally prove vile enough to desert.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">But to return to my account. While in Southampton he obtained his living by selling fruit about the streets, using a great deal of profane drollery to obtain custom and to amuse those who were disposed to be amused with it, but to the great annoyance of the decent inhabitants*[5] </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Having thus far given the reader an outline of Richard&#39;s character in his Youth, Manhood, at home and abroad, I think that there can be but one opinion of him, that he was well nigh as bad a character as it is possible for a man to be.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">I have now brought down his history until eight months before his death. And an awful fact it is, that, during the whole of his life, we find not one trait savouring of sorrow for, or a disposition to, forsake his sinful ways. But men, whether they whether they will lay it to the heart or not, must find a TIME TO DIE! for &quot;it is appointed unto all men to die once, and after death, the judgement!&quot; so Richard found it. </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Early in this year (1834) he felt his bodily strength decay apace; this he partly attributed to sitting by the fire in wet clothes, he having none to change. Poor man! Happy would it have been for him if he had spent the money for comfortable clothes that he was accustomed to spend in ardent spirits, which, he acknowledged, had ruined (in connexion with other vices) his constitution, which was naturally strong. </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">But to proceed with the subject. For about eight months before his death he was able to do little but walk about, and even then he never walked in the HOUSE OF GOD. I was not aware of h is being so rapidly declining in health till within about four months of his death.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">About this period he sent to a person (who was often kind to him) saying how ill and distressed he was, and asking for a little assistance, which was sent. The friend also called to see him, and finding him so ill, spoke to the Rev. J. Crabb on the propriety of visiting him with a view if possible. of leading his mind to the all important concerns of salvation. From this time Mr. Crabb or myself (often both) visited him every day.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">I accompanied Mr. C. on his first visit, and was agreeably surprised at his receiving us so readily: he seemed pleased to think we were disposed to notice him at all. Mr. C. gave him some spiritual advice, and then prayed very kindly for him. He said, &quot;thank ye, thank ye, Mr. Crabb and Mr. Day.&quot;<br />
			The singularity of his history, the proverbial depravity of his character, and the evident shortness of his stay upon earth, together with his willingness to be visited by Christian friends, led us to resolve to spare no pains in endeavouring to lead this poor wanderer back to God; and when I inform my readers that he could not read a letter in a book; had never received any religious instruction when young; and, added to this, that he had never entered a place of public worship (except when in the army) for about forty years; they will easily conceive what a task devolved upon those who visited him. In short, he was ignorant of the scriptural way of salvation as any poor Hottentot. I do not say he never heard of Christ; of Heaven and Hell; but as to how a sinner was to obtain salvation, he did not know.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Mr. C. was telling him one day of the suffering of the Lord Jesus Christ for the salvation of sinners, upon which Richard said, &quot;Poor man, how I pity him!.&quot;</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">I shall now give a brief account of the substance of several conversations I had with him. At an early visit, I read and explained to him the parable of the prodigal son, as recorded in Luke xv., endeavouring to show him that the prodigal&#39;s conduct was to represent ours in departing from God, the means often by us to obtain happiness, and the misery we bring upon ourselves by sin and folly. I then said,&quot; do you understand this?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; he replied, &quot;that is exactly like me; it is me all over. My sinful life has brought me into the state I am in. What a wretch I have been all my life: I&#39;m the vilest sinner in town.&quot; When I explained to him the prodigal&#39;s return, and the welcome he received, and told him it was to represent the willingness of Almighty God to receive every poor sinner who came to him far pardon through the Lord Jesus Christ: &quot;God send&quot;, said he,&quot; that I may do so too.&quot; Then, with much feeling he said, &quot;Oh, that I had thought of this before.&quot; </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">I beg here to remark, that no portion of God&#39;s word seemed to interest his mind more than of the prodigal son. Often has he begged Mrs.----his landlady, to read to him. This was a new feature in his character; as before this, when anyone attempted to read the Bible, or any good book in the place where he was, he used to swear, and call them [6] Methodist, Hypocrites, etc. Poor Richard wished a hundred times he had been a Methodist, or any thing else that was good, when on his death bed! He now began to appear earnestly to inquire what he must do to be saved.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">At another visit he said to me, alluding to the prodigal son, &quot;Ah, sir, we be glad to get back to He&quot;, (to God) a phrase he often used, &quot;when we are we going to die; oh, if I had left my off my wicked ways before.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;if you feel that you are a wretched, hell-deserving sinner, God is willing to pardon you, vile as you have been, if you come to Him through Jesus Christ alone; he died for poor outcast sinners.&quot;<br />
			He clasped his hands together and said,&quot; O God grant me that I may be pardoned!&quot; He now lamented that he could not read. &quot;Oh,&quot; said he,&quot;that I could read, I could then turn to the chapters and read for myself.&quot;</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">At another time I said,&quot; The Lord has been long suffering towards you, in not cutting you down in the midst of your sins, as thousands have been; and sent to Hell!&quot; &quot;Oh,&quot;he said with emphasis, &quot;He has indeed been kind to me, such a wretch as I have been; but I have behaved very badly to He.&quot; Looking at me very earnestly he said,&quot; I have been the vilest creature that ever lived, only I never committed murder;&quot; adding, with shame and sorrow, &quot; I have been everything that is bad: never entering a place of worship except compelled to go with the regiment, and then I used to get out, if I could, and spend my time in the alehouse, drinking, and blaspheming God&#39;s holy name, and ridiculing religion. Fool that I was! Never&quot;, said he,&quot; could I let any thing alone that I could get hold of slyly. Ah, sir! little did Mr........think how I cheated him by taking the best of his fruit instead of the faulty, as soon as his back was turned.&quot; In this way he often reproached himself for his sins.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">At another visit I read to him the I<sup>st</sup> chapter of Isaiah, from the 2nd to the 7th verse, much such remarks on the conduct of sinners as the verses demand, adding, &quot;You see, Richard, God knows all about what sinners are, etc. &quot;Ah,&quot; said he,&quot;that&#39;s what He may say of me; and added, &quot;I fear it is now too late, for ever me to be pardoned.&quot; I then said, now I will read you another verse out of the same chapter, v.18.: &quot;Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord, though your sins be as scarlet,&quot; etc. Now, Richard, you see that though God knows how wicked you have been, he says, &quot;Come unto me.&quot; &quot;Oh,&quot; he said,&quot; that I had come before. He seemed to think himself too vile even to dare to hope for mercy, or to take comfort from even such a text as the last quoted, and felt he lay at the free mercy of God. He said, &quot;Perhaps God may have mercy upon me: I know I deserve nothing but Hell.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">A few weeks before his death (on a Saturday evening) I said to him, &quot;Should you like to go to the house of God once before you die? He replied, &quot;I should indeed, sir, but I could not walk so far if you was to give me a guinea,&quot; I promised to get him a chair. The next morning some of his fellow lodgers wheeled him to Zion Chapel. He listened with the deepest attention to the sermon, which was made particularly suitable to his case. This was probably the only gospel sermon that he had ever heard with serious attention throughout his whole life. I visited him the next day, and inquired how he liked the sermon? &quot;Oh,&quot; said he, &quot;it was was beautiful! How I wish I had always attended. Had I heard such preaching often, I should not have been so wicked.&quot; Here he bitterly reproached himself for neglect on the concerns of his soul, adding, &quot;When I went to see my mother, a few years ago, she asked me if I attend any place of worship. I told her I went to Mr. Crabb&#39;s Chapel; liar as I was, to deceive her so.&quot;</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">In the course of conversation, on the subject of his being under sentence of death, I asked him if he had any serious concern about his soul at that awful period. &quot;No,&quot; said he, &quot;nothing what I feel now.&quot; &quot;Then,&quot; said I, &quot;It is a great mercy that you were not cut off at that time, for you would have gone to Hell.&quot; I then endeavoured to turn the subject to advantage by remarking, how kind the officer was to take so much trouble to save you. &quot;Yes,&quot; he replied, &quot;he was a worthy officer.&quot; I then repeated the texts, &quot;God so loved the word that he gave his only begotten Son. that whosever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life,&quot; John iii 16: adding, &quot;he was wounded for your transgressions (sins).&quot; The officer was kind and grateful to you for your kindness to him; but oh Richard, you have not thought much about that kindness and mercy of God towards you, in giving his only Son to die for you. He looked astonished and said,&quot; No, indeed I never felt any care about it. Indeed, I never understood so much about it before.&quot; &quot;Well, &quot; said I,&quot; the death of Christ is the only foundation of a sinner&#39;s hope. We are deep in God&#39;s debt, and have nothing to pay God, for the sake of the sufferings of his Son, who died as a substitute for sinners who deserved eternal death, pardons all who, by true repentance come to him for mercy, trusting in him alone.&quot; He replied, &quot; I&#39;ll do my best for it.&quot;</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">At another time I said to him, &quot;If God were to spare you, and raise you to health, I fear you would join your wicked companions again.&quot; &quot;Oh, no, I wouldn&#39;t; NO, NO; I&#39;d stick close to the people of God.&quot; I had many fears lest Richard&#39;s repentance was like the repentance of too many, who cry out when they think they are going to die, promise how they will live if God will but spare them for a little longer; but when God in mercy hears their vows, and rebukes the compliant, and they get well, they soon get to their old companions, to the alehouse, to their oaths, and old habits; their promises forgotten, they shun the very [7] minister that visited, relieved, and prayed for them. </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Oh, reader! Is this your case? Then reflect, that day is coming when you WILL DIE. Perhaps you meant to serve God; then I will tell you where the error lies. You did what the bible says fools (that is unwise people) do;---trust in your own heart, in your own good resolutions.---&quot; He that trusteth thus in his own heart is a fool.&quot; Prov. Xxviii. 26. &quot;For the heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked.&quot; Jer. xvii 9. Ask God to give you a new heart; then, and then only, will you live a new life, a life of loving and serving God. I therefore begged of him to ask the Lord to give him heartfelt repentance, and never suffer him to rest till he obtained mercy and salvation at his hands, through Christ.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">At another time he said, &quot;I hope sir, Mr. Crabb and you never forsake me while I am alive; I have everything to learn. Oh, what a wicked fool I have been, left my soul to the last.&quot; &quot;Well Richard, said I, &quot;that&#39;s the time people generally put off repentance to. They serve the devil with their strength and best days, and think when sickness and their dying hour come, they will seek God.&quot; &quot;Ah, I wish they could know what I feel, they would not do so then; it is not so easy a work as they think; pain is enough then to bear; pain of body, without having a wicked life to think over.&quot; </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">At another visit, a friend who went with me remarked, &quot;the noise must disturb you;&quot; (a shoemaker, a fellow-lodger, was at work). &quot;Oh, no, sir,&quot; said he, &quot;that noise don&#39;t disturb me; it is the horrid swearing at the corner of the street that disturbs me; that disturbs my soul .Once I loved it; now I hate it; once I was as bad, and worse.&quot; He once said to Mr. Crabb, &quot;Oh, sir, I have sworn more oaths many miles from here than would fill a bushel basket, if they were only as big as a pin&#39;s head.&quot; Oh, that those who indulge in this unreasonable and wicked practise, would remember these three texts: &quot;Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.&quot; Exod. Chap. Xxx. V. 7. &quot;Because of swearing the land mourneth.&quot; Jer. Chap. Xxiii. 10. &quot;Every swearer shall be cut off.&quot; Zech. Chap v.7.<br />
			I begged him to pray to see some of his old companions, to warn them. &quot;If you wish it, sir,&quot; said he: &quot;not else: I never wish to see them any more; the sight and sound of them fills me with pain.&quot; Wicked people are but little comfort to one another in health, none in a dying hour.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">About a fortnight or so before his death he was taken with a convulsion fit; thinking himself, he cried out, &quot;I won&#39;t die, I can&#39;t die!&quot; On his recovering, a person said to him, &quot; Oh Richard, you should not have said so; you should have composed yourself, and quietly submitted to your Maker&#39;s will.&quot; He replied, &quot;I could not help it. I knew, I felt I was not fit to die!&quot; Reader, you shudder, and well you may; but need we wonder at a sinner crying out when he feels his sins unforgiven, and his never dying soul about to enter an eternal state? Richard&#39;s conscience was awake, and if ours was also, we should not rest till we had sought and found pardon and salvation through Jesus Christ. </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">I knew two death-bed cases like this in London; one was an old sabbath-breaker and drunkard, about fifty years of age. I spoke to him about his soul, but it was of no use; he refused to turn from his sin, and literally drank himself to death, as many are doing in this and every town, village and hamlet throughout the land. When dying, he got out of bed and cried out, I won&#39;t die, I won&#39;t die,&quot; and then expired! The other case was that of a tradesman&#39;s wife. She was a fine woman, but addicted to the use of ardent spirits. One day she asked for a looking glass; upon seeing death marked on her countenance, she exclaimed, &quot;Oh, that death! That death! But I won&#39;t die yet!&quot; she fell back in her chair and breathed her last- How awful. What a confirmation of that text, The wicked is driven away in his wickedness.&quot; Oh, reader, may the Lord make us wise to consider out latter end while in health. </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">At another visit, soon after this, he said to me,&quot; I feel my sins a greater burden than ever; I fear I shall never be saved. The sins of my whole life stare me in the face; I know not what to do. I have been praying ever since you first visited me, but now I seem worse than ever.&quot; I told him I was glad that he thus felt his sins; that it was a sign that God was showing him more and more of the badness of his heart, that he might be led to see there was no other refuge for his guilty soul but the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. &quot; I know,&quot; he said, &quot; I have not one good deed; never did any good in my life.&quot; I told him our goodness was nothing in God&#39;s sight; that all are by nature helpless, sinful creatures; and that there was but one way of salvation; that way was Christ. I then read to him the 28th verse of the 11th chapter of Matthew:_ &quot;Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.&quot; &quot;Rest,&quot; said I, &quot;means pardon and comfort, that is what you want.&quot; &quot;The very thing,&quot; said he. &quot;Well, Richard, if you feel as you say, and I believe you do, and feel grieved at your very soul that you sinned against the blessed God, the blessed Saviour, you are the very person invited to come unto him just as much as if the Lord Jesus Christ were to send an angel from heaven to say, Richard Titheridge, you may come.&quot; He seemed greatly moved, I said, &quot;is this not kind?&quot;. &quot;Yes,&quot; said he, &quot;too kind.&quot; I then quoted several suitable texts: &quot;As I live,&quot; saith God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked.&quot; Ezek. Xxxiii. 11. &quot;This is a faithful saying, worthy and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.&quot; 1 Tim. I. 15. &quot;Him that cometh unto me I will in nowise will he cast out.&quot; John vi. 37. I said, &quot;you see , Richard, this text takes you in. (explaining it to him); in nowise will he cast you out, though an old sinner, a horrid sinner, the vilest sinner.&quot; He looked at me, as much as to say, Is it true? I exhorted him to pray for faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, as it is written, &quot;whosoever believeth in him should not perish.&quot; I also related to him the case of the poor distressed publican, who, feeling his sins a burden, cried,&quot; God be merciful to me a sinner.&quot; Luke xviii. 13. And that Jesus Christ said he was pardoned, and went down to his house very happy. Also the case of the dying thief upon the cross. His prayer, &quot;Lord, remember me.&quot; And the Saviour&#39;s answer, &quot;This day thou shalt be with me in paradise.&quot; (heaven). Luke xxiii. 42, 43. Also the case of the poor wick Mary Magdalen, who lived when Jesus was upon earth, heard him preach, became a penitent sinner, and one day went to Jesus Christ for pardon, but could not say a word, only wept; and that Jesus Christ said to her, Thy sins, which are many, are all forgiven thee.&quot; Luke vii.37,38, 48.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">If the Lord would thus give you to feel that your sins are forgiven, and I trust he will, how happy would you be; then you would not be afraid to die, would you? Clasping his thin and wasted hands together, as he lay in bed, he replied, &quot;no, no, I should then be glad to depart:&quot; and then he broke out thus, &quot; O for that happy day, that happy hour! O what a day, what an hour that would be, it would be the happiest day I ever saw since the day I was born; but I am afraid I shall never see it.&quot;</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">The Rev. Mr. Crabb was one day endeavouring to direct his distressed soul to Jesus, assuring him that God would for Christ&#39;s sake pardon his sins, adding, &quot;then, Richard, you will not be afraid to die.&quot; He looked up with much earnestness, and said, &quot;No indeed, for if I was sure God had pardoned my sins, I would get up an run to St. Mary&#39;s, (meaning the burial ground) and glad to depart my blessed Jesus; (the best way he could express his willingness to die.)</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">From the time of the visit last recorded, I felt more hope of Richard&#39;s sound conversion than ever, and visited him with more comfort to my own mind, [8] being fully persuaded that he might now be considered a humble broken-hearted sinner, sitting at the feet of Jesus, and looking to him for salvation.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">At another visit I carried him a little wine; he expressed his thankfulness for it, and for the many kindnesses he was receiving from one friend or another every day, adding, &quot;I never could have thought any body would have felt so much concern about me; but the best of it all is, you and the other gentlemen that visits me, are so kind to my poor soul.&quot; I said,&quot; you must not depend upon man; you must look to Christ; all that we can do is to tell you of Jesus, and the way to be saved through him, and to pray for you.<br />
			He replied, &quot; I know that you cannot save me, but you can and do teach me what I never knew before.&quot; I said, there are many who never come to see you who are very much concerned about your soul; they feel a love to Christ, and to you, and every other poor sinner for his sake, often praying that you may be converted and born again; for they know unless that great change takes place in your heart, you can never be saved. </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">He listened with great attention, burst into tears, and said, &quot; while you have been loving him, I have been hating him, and making fun,&quot; (meaning ridiculing religion and religious people). I said, were you happy when you were making sport at serious things? &quot;No,&quot; said he, &quot;I often thought it wouldn&#39;t turn out well at last!&quot; What did you do when you had these thoughts? &quot;&quot;Oh,&quot; he said, &quot;I got to my old companions, sometimes got a good drunk, and thus drove it all away;-it didn&#39;t last long.&quot; </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">I said, I will repeat a verse of a hymn to you: I then repeated the following. &quot;Tis religion that can give Sweetest pleasures while we live &quot;Tis religion must supply Solid comfort when we die.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">I then said, &quot;Do you think that is true?&quot; &quot;O yes,&quot; said he, &quot; it is nothing but the truth; if I had served God I should have been happy instead of being such a miserable sinner as I have been all my days.&quot; I closed this visit by again pointing him to Jesus, repeating and explaining the following text: He died, &quot;the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God,&quot; (into his favour). 1 Pet. iii. 18 &quot;For by grace are ye (poor penitent sinners) saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God.&quot; Eph. Ii. 8. Exhorting him to meditate much on the sufferings of Christ in the garden of Gethsemane; on the cross; and to remember it was all for poor wretched sinners who came to God through him. I could relate the substance of several other conversations, but I must now hasten to give an account of my last visit to poor Richard.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">On Tuesday, Dec 11 he sent for me and Mr. Crabb in haste, as he felt himself dying. I went immediately, and at the same time sent to inform Mr. C. who happened to be from home. On my entering the room where he lay, I saw that hand of death was indeed upon him,; he was, however, perfectly sensible, and able to speak. I asked him if he felt his mind was comfortable. He replied, &quot; not so comfortable as I could wish, but I have hope that he will have mercy on my soul.&quot; [This was spoken with a measure of confidence he had not expressed before.] I exhorted him to keep his mind steadfastly looking to Jesus, to cast his guilty soul upon him for salvation; to plead the promise, &quot;Him that cometh unto me I will in nowise cast out; and to tell the Lord his only hope is in Him.&quot; He replied, &quot;I&#39;ll die looking to Christ alone,&quot; I then prayed with him, in which he joined earnestly; his sufferings at this time were very great. After prayer, I sat down at his bedside, and suggested such portions of truth to his mind as his case demanded, particularly the ability and willingness of Christ to save even to the uttermost all that come unto God by him. I said, Richard, shall I pray again? He replied, &quot;do.&quot; We knelt down (myself and two poor women who attended him) and prayed with him for the last time [many tears were shed by the poor women] and commended his departing spirit into the hands of God; and though he had not that sensible joy that we so much wished, we trust that God had mercy on him and pardoned his sins-it was solemn season. After prayer he reached out his dying hand ( I seem to feel it while writing) and said,&quot; I thank you a hundred times for your kind attention to me, and I thank Mr. Crabb and Mr. Milligan, and all the friends who have visited and prayed for my wretched soul,&quot; adding, &quot;every body about me has been kind to me.&quot; I said, &quot;goodbye, I hope I shall meet you in heaven&quot;. His countenance brightened, and he said, &quot;God grant I may meet you and Mr. Crabb too, and all my kind friends.&quot;</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">I took his dying hand in mind once more, and bade him farewell, to see him no more, till I myself become an inhabitant of the world of spirits. He continued perfectly sensible till the last moment, able to speak till within a few minutes of his death. He lay, bewailing his sins, naming many, especially his dishonesty, and crying to God for pardon through the blood of Christ. His last words were, &quot;Come Lord Jesus, and receive my departing spirit, and pardon my sins.&quot; He expired at 3:00 o&#39;clock on Friday morn, December 12, 1834, and on Sunday afternoon following, his emaciated remains were carried to the grave (the house appointed for all living) by four men from the poorhouse, a man and a woman, his fellow lodgers, following as mourners. I saw the funeral, and from the smallness of the number of mourners, and none attending even as spectators, I could not help saying, &quot;There go the remains of poor Richard Titheridge, who through his wickedness lived unrespected and died unlamented&quot;.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">This text also forcibly came into my mind, &quot;Them that honor me, I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed&quot;. Sam. Ii.20.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">If I am asked my opinion of Richard&#39;s future state, my answer is this; looking at the whole case, and witnessing as I did, the apparent deep sorrow of his heart for his sin; his utter renunciation of all hopes of salvation, but through the unmerited mercy of God in Jesus Christ, I cannot help viewing his as a brand plucked from the everlasting burnings.-Zech.iii.2.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">In closing this account, the following reflections naturally suggest themselves to the mind:--</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">First, the great importance of religious instruction. And suffer me to remark, that whatever excuse there might have been for parents neglecting the religious instruction of their children fifty years ago, there can be none at this time, when there are Sunday Schools established in almost every town and village in the kingdom. At the same time permit me to say, that the duty belongs in the first place to the parents themselves. - &quot;Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.&quot;-Prov.xxii.6. Moses, speaking in the name of the Lord, said to the Israelites, &quot;And these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart, and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children; and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.&quot; Deut. Vi.6,7.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">See also Eph. Vi. 3: &quot;And ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath, but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord&quot;. Let us, who are parents, reflect upon the awful responsibility of our situation. Oh, let us take heed, lest the souls of our children be lost through our neglect.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">To the youthful reader of this account, I will offer the following remarks. Richard was a lying, Sabbath breaking, and dishonest boy, and though frequently punished, he hardened his heart against all reproof; the consequence was, as it ever will be, that he grew up a wicked man. But mind you, he was never happy, nor will you be happy until you turn away from your folly and sin. He was disobedient to his mother, like many youth of this and every town. Let me intreat you to reflect on the following texts: &quot;Honour thy father and mother, that thy days may be long in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee&quot;. Exxod.xx.12. Ephes. V.1. Read the curses pronounced against disobedient children. &quot;Cursed is he that setteth light by his father and mother. An all the people shall say , Amen&quot;.Deut.xxvii 16. And &quot;The eye that mocketh at his father and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.&quot; Prov. Xxx.17. This means, that God will send great and heavy judgments upon the disobedient.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Richard often said to me. &quot;If I had obeyed by mother, I never should have suffered as I have all through life&quot;. Oh, take warning! Pray to god to give you grace to &quot;Remember him, your Creator, in the days of your youth,&quot; Eccles.xii.1., then you will experience the truth of that sweet verse in Dr. Watt&#39;s Divine Songs; then you will prove a blessing to your Parents and not a curse. </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">&quot;Twill save us from a thousand snares To mind religion young; Grace will preserve our following years, and make our virtue strong.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">This history of Richard ought to act as a warning to those who give way to sin of drunkenness. &quot;It has ruined my constitution,&quot; says he, &quot;and there are many who, if they would speak out, must acknowledge that it is ruining theirs daily.&quot; Oh that such persons would but consider the numberless evils attending this vice! It has turned many a kind father to worse than a brute. I have known several cases in which the husband and the father (I blush at the fact) has taken the last shilling for drink, whilst his wife and children have been left without even bread to eat! Besides this, it has been proved that more than half the criminal cases at the assizes and session throughout the country, are owing to drunkenness. </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">I have before me a statement on which I can depend, in which it is said, that a very large proportion of the lunatic case are traceable to the same source! I might add, without fear of contradiction, that very many accidents, both by sea and land, may be attributed to the same source. I will now give the reader the opinion of a very eminent physician (Sir Astley Cooper, Bart.) on the subject of intemperance.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">His words are, No person has greater hostility to dram drinking than myself, insomuch that I never suffer any ardent spirits in my house, thinking them evil spirits; and if the poor could witness the white livers, the dropsies, the shattered nervous systems which I have seen as the consequence of drinking, they would be aware that spirits and poison were synonymous terms (words meaning the same thing). But if these statements produce no effect, suffer me to add, drunkards are ruining our youth by bad example. It is really awful to a reflecting mind to see how many young persons are encouraged by old hardened drunkards to pursue the same course. What a meeting may we not expect such will experience at the day of Judgment, when sinners will no doubt mutually upbraid each other for leading them into sin!</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Once more and I have done. God has classed this with the most horrid sins that human beings can commit. Read the catalogue in 1<sup>st</sup> Cor.vi.9,10. &quot;Drunkards shall not inherit the kingdom of God&quot;. Oh, reflect! Fall upon your knees before God; beg of Him grace to restrain and to convert your soul from all sins. Recollect it is not human vows and resolutions will produce this change; it must be sought, and can only be found, at the hand of God.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">The case of a murderer demands a few observations, but I am at a loss to know what language to make use of, in order to describe the horror which such circumstances is calculated to fill the mind. Here we see a man rising against his fellow man, plunging a knife into his throat (my soul chills with horror whilst I write) his victim struggles, then falls to rise no more! Thus barbarously does he hurry his fellow-creature in a moment into the eternal world.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">He washes the blood from his hands, but ah! not all the waters of the ocean could wash his guilty conscience;--he lives a few years and dies upon his bed, and thus he escapes the sentence which the laws of God and his country would justly have inflicted upon him had he been found guilty. But he could not escape the judgment of Him who has said, &quot;Thou shalt do no murder;&quot; and &quot;Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord.&quot; In what state of mind the culprit alluded to departed this life, we must leave till the Great day. May the Lord preserve us from ever being placed in such awful circumstances. </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">The dying testimony of Richard ought to prove a warning to all who are putting off repentance till the time of sickness and death. Hear his words, &quot;What a wicked fool I have been, left my soul to the last.&quot;<br />
			On being told that that was the time sinners generally considered to be time enough, he said, &quot;If they could but know what I feel, it is not easy as they think,&quot;. Surely such expressions as these, coming from the lips of a sinner on his dying bed, should lead us to reflect upon the folly and danger of neglecting our souls.<br />
			Suffer me to attempt to give the reader a faint idea of the bitter reflections of his mind, when he felt there was no hope of recovery.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">REFLECTIONS </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">&quot;Here I am on my death bed! My body will soon be in the grave, but what will become my soul? I have lied only to sin against God. I have often been warned that a life of sin must end in sorrow, but I would not regard it. I have heard of Christ dying for sinners, but I would not trouble myself about seeking pardon at his hands. I have had thousands of opportunities of hearing the gospel, but I neglected them. My Sabbaths have all been spent in sin, and are gone for ever, and I must soon appear before that God, whose mercies I have so long abused. He that has heard every oath I have sworn. Every lie I have told, seen every act I have committed. O wretched fool that I am, would to God I had never been born. O that I had been shot when I was brought out to be executed, then I should not have had so many sins to answer for. O eternity! Lord have mercy upon my soul!<br />
			But I fear it is too late! For ever too late!! O that had turned from my sins before!&quot;</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Hear this, you that have hitherto trifled with your souls, and trifle no longer, lest you know in you own experience what these bitter reflections mean. Which of us can say, we shall have time to reflect and pray on the sick bed? How many are killed by accident, seized with fevers, or lose their reason; all of which may prevent the possibility of attending to the concerns of the soul. And suffer me to add, there is an awful possibility of seeking mercy when it cannot be found. Read and tremble while you read &quot;Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; but ye have set at nought all my counsels, and would none of my reproof: I also will laugh at your calamity,&quot; Prov. i.24. to the end of the chapter.<br />
			Thank God there is yet hope for you and every sinner that will turn from his sin. For thus saith the Lord. &quot;Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.&quot;-Isa.lv.7.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Should any reader be ready to say, &quot;I need not be so much concerned about by soul, I have a good heart, have lived a good life,&quot; etc., permit me to refer such to the following texts, Isa. Liii.6. Rom. Iii.9, and following verses, Romviii.6-8. Luke xiii,1-5.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">From these and hundreds of other texts, we learn that &quot;by the deeds of the law there shall be no flesh justified in his sight; for by the law is the knowledge of sin, For all of sinned, and come short of the glory of God.&quot; - Rom iii. 20 &amp; 23. Do you ask what you must do to be saved? The answer is plain, &quot;Believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved; He was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for out justification&quot;. Rom.iv.25.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Should this book fall into the hands of any poor distressed sinner, upon whom the weight of past transgressions sits as a burden upon his guilty soul, too heavy to be borne, one who is ready to say, here is no hope; to such a character I would say, read and meditate upon those scriptures that were pointed out to Richard; from them you will learn that God delighteth not in the eternal death of sinners, but rather that they would turn to him and live.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Come to Christ as you are, a poor helpless sinner, and you, even you, vile as you feel yourself to be, shall obtain mercy, &quot;For the blood of Christ cleanseth from all sin.&quot; As a help to prayer, read the 51st Psalm. I should also recommend you to open your mind to some pious friend or gospel minister, who will rejoice to point out to you more fully the only way in which you can be saved. Let me entreat you not to attempt to drown your concern about your soul in sinful pleasures; neither suffer any one to baffle you out of it. Many will say to you, hold your peace. The devil will suggest to your mind that it is now too late. But be not dismayed, Jesus already looks upon you with pity, as the father of the prodigal did upon his returning son. Act the part of the blind man, recorded in Luke xviii.35-39, who when told to hold his peace, cried so much the more. He was blessed by the Saviour, and so shall you; &quot;Fear not, only believe, and you shall see the salvation of God.&quot;</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">I now commend this book to the blessing of the Almighty God, with humble prayer that it may be the means of leading many poor sinners to reflect upon their sin and danger while neglecting their immortal souls, and leading their wandering feet into the way of eternal life.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">There is now living in Winchester a brother of the subject of this memoir, and who, like him, was of an eccentric turn of mind. He formerly acted as post-boy at the &#39;White Hart&#39;, where he went under the appellation of &quot;Pretty Joey.&quot; Amongst the many incidents of his life, was the performance of an extraordinary feat of horsemanship, during the trial of Sir John Murray for cowardice, being employed to convey despatches to London for six successive days, starting off each evening and back the following morning. He is now an inmate of the Union, where, from the exhortations of the Rev. Chaplain, he has been brought into such a happy state of mind as will enable him to close his earthly career as becomes a true Christian.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">[1] See Reflections at the end of the book<br />
			[2]Though actually placed in such awful circumstances, he was so hardened as actually to keep his victuals in the coffin, and sometimes lay in it .<br />
			[3]He told a person he was conversing with on the subject, that the officer&#39;s horse looked as if it was covered with snow, from the excessive haste he was obliged to make, in order to be in time to save his life. This proves him to have been a gentleman worthy of the high station he held in the British army.<br />
			[4]Here I cannot help relating a rather amusing circumstance that occurred when he was brought out to be whipped. When he was tied to the cart, he said to the man appointed to perform the whipping&quot;mind, you are not to strike me any where but on my back.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; said the man. &quot;Nor yet but when the cart is going?&quot; &quot;no,&quot; said the man. &quot;Well,&quot; said Richard, &quot;wait till that gentleman behind us is gone by.&quot; The man turned around to look, in the meantime Richard, giving a sudden spring, threw his feet and back into the cart, at the same time calling out to the driver, &quot;drive away!&quot; And thus he was carried through the streets, with his head hanging out of the cart at the cart&#39;s tail, to the no small amusement of the spectators. This is a perfect description of Richard, as those who knew can testify.<br />
			[5]He had a peculiar manner of whistling, which he taught a bird (a starling) so perfectly to imitate, that many who were in another part of the house have taking for Richard himself. Since his death it has been sold to a gentleman in this town.<br />
			[6]I once knew a wicked man, who said he would sooner be damned than be a Methodist.! Poor sinner!<br />
			[7] This is often the case, as every minister of the gospel is well ware.<br />
			[8] None but those who feel the value of their own souls, can form any proper idea of the feelings of a gospel minister when called upon to visit the ungodly sick; especially when (as in Richard&#39;s case) the individual had had no previous Christian instruction; added to this, there is so much self-righteousness in the poor sinner&#39;s mind, which is unhappily encouraged by those who around him, who are for stifling any proper concern that may be evinced by the suffer.-Hence, they tell him to say his prayers, and trust in God; that God is so merciful that he will be sure to go to heaven. From such instructors and comforters, good Lord deliver all my readers.</font></p>

			Subject: The Unforgettable Dickey Dung Prong</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Dear Editor,</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Some names are completely unforgettable and so it was, as an ex-editor, that I recognised the name in John Tidridge&#39;s article published in the December 2010 Family Historian. I knew in an instant that I had published an article entitled &#39;The Life of Dickey Dung Prong Titheridge (1788 - 1834)&#39; and so searched through my collection of back journals to find it. Covering pages 174 to 177, there it was in the November 2000 Hampshire Family Historian, but by different authors named Ann and Mike Titheradge, then resident near Brighton. Tis said, &quot;If it&#39;s a good story, it&#39;s worth telling twice.&quot;</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">That article of a decade ago referred interested parties to their website, perhaps now defunct, and concluded with the couple&#39;s location of Richard Titheridge&#39;s burial entry in Southampton&#39;s St Michael parish registers on 14<sup>th</sup> December 1834, the deceased being &quot;of Simnel Street&quot;. </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">I would recommend that John should read Ann and Mike&#39;s article because it contains snippets of their personal research to prove or disprove Richard&#39;s version of events as related in the religious publication. John Tidridge&#39;s membership number 13078 seems comparatively recent, so perhaps he may be unaware that most HGS journals (magazines to the uninitiated) have been surname indexed and previous articles can be obtained easily. The HGS office always provided photocopies for a small sum if an original magazine was unavailable, although I see now that a DVD series has been commenced with the first ten years of the publication until 1984 being covered.</font></p>
