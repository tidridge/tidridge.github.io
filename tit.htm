<p> In order to present (it is hoped) a more direct link to individuals their ancestors will be added above the last personally known family member. It is hoped this will not confuse issues. It should also be noted that the Tidridge clan enjoys(?) many and varied spellings of their names.</p><hr>

<p style="text-indent:50px"><br>Do you cover the name <b>TITRIDGE</b> on your site ?  If you do, I have a reference for you.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px">I was hoping above all hope that that name did not exist...but sure, please send the reference. When I was in the Police service, there was a sergeant who insisted and  persisted in calling my name as 'Titridge'. I guess I finally got fed and on roll call, he called out 'Titridge' and I just stood there. He did this three times and then asked why I did not respond. I told it was because my name was 'Tidridge'. I got a lecture, he got the message, and he called me 'Tidridge' from that day on!! </p>

<p style="text-indent:50px">You are quite right - the name <b>TITRIDGE</b> does not in fact exist. There is however a reference to it in the British 1881 census. where  an Albert TITRIDGE, aged 13 years, an under shepherd, born at Bishops Waltham, Hampshire, is shown as living as a boarder with Richard MAIDMENT, a shepherd, and his family at Rowhay Farm, Owslebury, Hampshire. (Richard is not related to me , but is related to a fellow MAIDMENT researcher.)</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px">I have checked the 1891 census for Hampshire, which I have on CD rom,  and also the national 1901 census, which is now available on the Internet, and in both cases Albert's surname is shown to be TITHERIDGE.   The 1881 entry is therefore clearly a mistake. There are no entries for TITRIDGE in the indices of the Hampshire 1891 census, or the British Vital Records.   Albert is the only one in the British 1881 census and the world wide Mormon IGI / census site.</p>


<p style="text-indent:50px">As a matter of interest, a check of the 1901 British census reveals a total of 229 TITHERIDGEs, 28 TIDRIDGEs and 11 TITHERAGEs. </p>


<p style="text-indent:50px">For the information of your members, the 1901 British census on the Internet is now working well after a troublesome start.  Whilst there is a charge for viewing and downloading the actual census entries, the following information can be viewed and downloaded free of charge.  Name, age, where born,  administrative county and civil parish where living at time of census, occupation.   Try <a href="http://www.pro.gov.uk">www.pro.gov.uk</a> then click on 1901 census online, then name search. Another very useful pay as you go site, opened on the first of this month, is that for the British births, marriages and deaths indices 1837 - 2001. <a href="http://www.1837online.com">www.1837online.com</a>
