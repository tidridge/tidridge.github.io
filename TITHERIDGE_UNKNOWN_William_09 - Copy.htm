			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Recorded as Tedridge, Tidridge, Titherridge and possibly others, this is an English surname. It is locational and of medieval origin and describes a person who lived &#39;atta ridge,&#39; which is also the name of a now apparently &quot;lost&quot; medieval village in the Hampshire area. Locational surnames are usually &#39;from&#39; names. That is to say names given to people after they left their original village to move somewhere else.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Spelling over the centuries being at best erratic and local accents very thick, soon lead to the development of &#39;sounds like&#39; surname spellings. In this case examples of the name development over the centuries and taken from the surviving registers of the county of Hampshire include William Titherige of Cheriton, on November 18<sup>th</sup> 1705, James Tidridge, a witness at New Alresford Independent Church on October 12<sup>th</sup> 1834, whilst on February 4<sup>th</sup> 1844, Jane Tedridge, the daughter of Henry and Ann was christened at Bishops Waltham. The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of John Titheridge. This was dated June 13<sup>th</sup> 1642 when he married Erne Garret at Bighton, North Petersfield, during the reign of King Charles 1<sup>st</sup> of England, 1625 1649.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Surnames became necessary when governments introduced personal taxation. In England this was sometimes known as the Poll Tax. Throughout the centuries, surnames in every country have continued to &quot;develop&quot; often leading to astonishing variants of the original spelling.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">In order to present (it is hoped) a more direct link to individuals their ancestors will be added above the last personally known family member. It is hoped this will not confuse issues. It should also be noted that the Tidridge clan enjoys(?) many and varied spellings of their names.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span>&nbsp;</span>William Rayner, labourer, and of Barton&rsquo;s Village, when going homeward, about 11.15 on Monday night, met deceased walking close to Sharland&rsquo;s coal store.&nbsp;&nbsp;Deceased&rsquo;s head was bowed, and his hands were behind him. Witness bade him &ldquo;good night&rdquo;, and deceased seem to take no heed of the salutation. Witness stopped and watched him turn and come back, and then it seemed that deceased noticed that he was being watched, and passed round the corner towards the bridge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

There were no marks of violence about the body, which would indicate foul play and there was no shingle found in the clenched hands, which would favour the supposition that an effort had been made by the deceased to save himself from drowning.</span></span></span></div>
