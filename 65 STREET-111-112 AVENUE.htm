			Hello again!<br />
			<br />
			Recently I wrote to you to see if you could identify a doctor by an address...ha!<br />
			<br />
			Now I have the Doctor&#39;s name, Dr, Hugh B. Russell who practiced at 11157<br />
			65 Street and 6427 112 Avenue which is actually the same building [the Gibbard Block]. He lived at 11132-60 Street. He worked from the site circa 1958-1961. Are you able to tell me if the good doctor remained in practice in Edmonton. Why you may ask? A now friend, from the United States, lived in Edmonton at that time and was just curious..he is an author.<br />
			<br />
			Thank you,<br />
			<br />

In reading all about your findings on 112 ave I was very intrigued and have a few things to add. I may be wrong but for some darn reason my memory is much better from 50/60&rsquo;s than last week. I think the Cozy Corner cafe was there till 1963 as I used to go there when I was around 13-14 and play the juke box.(not that I didn&rsquo;t go to Jamison&rsquo;s as well) the Cozy was stated on your write up two different years 1953 or 1960. The Highlands Barber Shop in the early years 1952-1959 was called it Ernie&rsquo;s as that was the owners name so everyone called it Ernie&rsquo;s. The barber shop in Bellevue was called Wally&rsquo;s in the 50&rsquo;s. The gas station at 7601 -112 ave was called Graham&rsquo;s service and was a BA service around 1950-1960. Highland Motors the first station and it was a Royalite gas station. The A&amp;W&nbsp; was open till 1967 not 1964. Now the Dr. Russell mystery......when Dr. Hutton was&nbsp; in Bellevue and was not available I was taken to Dr. Russell a few times. I know you spoke to Yvonne on this subject and she indicated he was in the Gibbard building.....I am 99.9% sure he was located in the same building as the Highlands Bakery located in the South side of the building. I remember there used to be two separate doors on the front of the building; the door on the left was the bakery entrance and the right door was Dr. Russell&#39;s office. It was only about 500 sq.ft. at the very most. Not sure if anyone will remember this ? Love your articles and all the memories.<br />

			First things first: When we moved into our home in 1963 there was an &#39;Underschultz&#39; elderly couple living on the west side of 60 Street, the first home north of 113 Avenue, they came down to our garden and expressed some surprise at the lack of vegetables being grown!<br />
			<br />
			Second: The information I have recorded came 99.99% from Henderson&#39;s Directories. These directories were published on an annual basis and I have found they were not 100% accurate, mainly through human error and complicated interactions with store owners.<br />
			<br />
			Third: The elusive doctor:&nbsp; I think it would be impolite of me to question Yvonne&#39;s version of events. You are suggesting the office was in the same building as their business and home... and that Yvonne is mistaken...would take a braver man than me to question that!

			<p>Thanks for copying me on this. I simply don&#39;t know what to make of Linda&#39;s contention that Dr. Russell&#39;s office was in the bakery building. I distinctly remember going in the center (right) door and the bakery goods (and bread slicer) were on that south wall. The door on the left, of course, opened to stairs to the upper-level living quarters. Given my memory of going into the doctor&#39;s office up a few steps into the back of the west side, Yvonne&#39;s (who lived right there!) memories, plus the licensing address of 11157 which was not the bakery, I&#39;d say it&#39;s a 99% chance the good doctor was in the Gibbard. However, Linda does have interesting and specific memories of the neighborhood, so I remain baffled at her doctor office comments.</p>

			May 18, 2018 Well, John, I finally sat down and read your book which was quite the pleasure! I particularly liked the story of the plumber; to think he was there all the years I was - what an interesting gentleman! Thank you again for sending it; it certainly spurred many memories. A few random thoughts ...&nbsp;Borden Park was a place we did not <img src="vonfange-1.png" style="border-top: 0px solid; height: 347px; border-right: 0px solid; width: 241px; border-bottom: 0px solid; float: left; margin-left: 10px; border-left: 0px solid; margin-right: 10px" />frequent, but there was one major event, long before Klondike Days. I remember it as the Edmonton Exhibition and we&#39;d trek west along 113th avenue to get to the park. Strangely, I remember little about what went on every summer at the exhibition, but I have vivid memories of jets (The Blue Angels maybe) screaming over our house as part of that celebration, barely clearing the trees from my elementary school perspective.&nbsp;Also interesting is that I don&#39;t remember going to the Highlands Park. However, we&#39;d go skating at the rink just north of 113th avenue on 62nd street. I fondly recall purchasing yellow blocks of &quot;Sea Foam&quot; candy for five cents. That building must have been the Highland&#39;s Community Center?&nbsp;I also remember between the rink and Highland&#39;s School was a Quonset-type building where we would meet for Cub Scouts&nbsp;I am amazed when I look at a map today and realize for two years (4th and 5th grades) every day I walked to and from our house on 65th street to Mount Royal on 55th street, taking 113th avenue the whole way except for a brief jog north on 58th street,<img src="vonfange-3.png" style="border-top: 0px solid; height: 305px; border-right: 0px solid; border-bottom: 0px solid; float: right; margin-left: 10px; border-left: 0px solid; margin-right: 10px" /> very near to where your house is/was! That must have been quite the trek during the long winters.&nbsp;I found a clipping in my Dad&#39;s materials (below) but don&#39;t know from what publication it came. As you mention about Henderson&#39;s accuracy, this list managed to misspell our last name, my father&#39;s name and my mother&#39;s name.&nbsp;There is&nbsp;a photo of my Dad and I working in the living room of 11314 65th street. I remember every room of that house and would love to see it again some day&nbsp;I noted you worked with/for Transit in Edmonton. Another fond memory is the electric trolley (?) buses that ran on 112th avenue. I would go to the bus stop just east of Safeway on 112th and 65th and go to my dentist (Dr. Teppo in the Tegler building) or to my church (Grace Lutheran, 9907 114th Street), traversing Jasper Avenue with all its sights! The bus would occasionally stop because one of the long poles (don&#39;t know the terminology) would come off the track of the overhead wire and the driver would pull on the rope (they would coil up in a round spring-loaded container on the back of the bus) to pull the pole down and reconnect it with the wire, and off we&#39;d go. I&#39;m sorry to see those were all eliminated.&nbsp;Well, thanks for listening! Always enjoy hearing from you.&nbsp;Paul.</p>
