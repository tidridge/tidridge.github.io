			<p align="left" class="western" pbzloc="1" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">&nbsp;The Guards Depot at Caterham, Surrey, UK is a place always remembered by those whose attendance at same was required.&nbsp;I thought, initially,</p>

			<p align="justify" class="western" pbzloc="5" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">I will only say we were blessed with a TS who knew the ropes and taught us well. That does not mean all his efforts would have been condoned by the &lsquo;powers that be&rsquo;. On the other hand...there was many blind eye turned...might be a good idea to have some pictures or cartoons if you like, about the place.Then I thought why not add text and twist the arms of a couple or three volunteers to add their thoughts.</p>

			<p align="left" class="western" pbzloc="8" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">&nbsp;I already have my own group and they will be asked to contribute...&nbsp;I would surmise my experiences were much the same as other who attended. Most are kept secret, Most will express pride at having the run the course and not found wanting.</p>

			<p class="western" pbzloc="1" style="text-align: left">I have given some thought to writing something which I found humorous while at the Depot and must say that in truth&nbsp; there is nothing I found humorous. Pride in having been through the process, yes, in a way, but then there was no choice unless you, like two of our squad did, tried to commit suicide. What I found most fulfilling was meeting all the other squad members from all over UK and relating to them.</p>

Goodness knows why I selected this item as the first of what I hoped would be a series of drawings related to the Guards Depot at Caterham, Surrey, UK. I can remember only one instance when we got our boots dirty and our Drill Instructor had a conniption! The period before the upcoming drill parade was spent doing field work...I don&rsquo;t remember exactly what, but in any event we were excused drill. Whoopee! The Depot has long be shut down and the land developed into a housing project.</font></font></p>

			<p align="justify" class="western" pbzloc="36" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><font color="#1f497d" pbzloc="77">That having been said, nothing will erase the 12-14 week experience of the Deport from your mind, while instructors did their&nbsp; best to transform you from a citizen into a Guardsman.</font></p>

			<p align="left" class="western" pbzloc="37" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><font color="#1f497d" pbzloc="77">This is a project the instructors throw themselves with the sometimes misapplied enthusiasm. However, this is not bone picking time, but let me just add: Next to the Depot was a Mental Institute, called by it&rsquo;s old fashioned name of Lunatic Asylum. It is rumoured that inmates considered they where getting the better deal compared to the recruits.</font></p>

			<p align="justify" class="western" pbzloc="83" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><font color="#1f497d" pbzloc="77">As I was typing I remembered why dirty boots has stuck in my mind for the last...well never mind. It was on Malta, I was a called back to service,reservist, and... a drill parade was called. I won&rsquo;t go onto all the details but it finished up that I was the only one who had agreed not to polish my boots, that actually did not spit and polish them. Three evening orders! Could have been a lot worse.</font></p>

This is where it all starts at Caterham: Enter through the Depot gates to be greeted by an NCO. The one I first met was a neighbour, but he did he&nbsp; let on that he knew me. Indeed he did not. Although several inches shorter than I, he made me feel about 4 feet tall. Sneering out from under his peaked cap he roared &ldquo;*Picquet&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Follow that man&rdquo; and off I went.</font></p>

If you were unfortunate to be in default of the many and various regulations, a non-commissioned officer might spot you, and &lsquo;ask&rsquo; for your name.

Our Drill Instructor was very smart...always immaculately turned out. One morning on the square when the DI&rsquo;s were 
inspected, it was found that he had weights in his pants. He was immediately &lsquo;rushed away&rsquo; and put on a charge.</i>

<i pbzloc="166">A new DI was found to take over our morning drills...a real comedian! It was around our fifth
 week. First up, Sgt Brown gave us an &lsquo;about turn&rsquo; command on the wrong foot. Well, you have never seen such a 
shambles...bumping into each other, arms flailing....it must have been comical to watch. He proceeded to try and 
teach us what to do if it happened again. It did....several times, on various commands. He was doing this deliberately
 to show us that, even if a command was given incorrectly, a good squad could handle it, with nary a twitch.</i></pre>
