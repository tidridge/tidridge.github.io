Go here to read about the battle of Cheriton: https://weaponsandwarfare.com/2019/09/13/the-battle-of-cheriton-i/</font></p>

			<p align="left" class="western" pbzloc="127"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" pbzloc="128">Cheriton was a small village, perhaps just big enough to support John in his tailoring business. John and Ann had seven children, and their first child died under the age of one year. </font></p>

			<p align="left" class="western"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">There are nine generations going back from my Dad, Walter </font><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>Sidney</b></font><font face="Arial, sans-serif" pbzloc="40"> to John of 1643. In that nine generations there are two Johns, three Williams, one Henry, two Harrys one Walter. These Dads shared a variety of surnames: Titheridge, Tytheridge, Tethreg, Tythereg. These are by no means the last of the names ascribed to the family. These discrepancies are blamed on the fact many people could not read or write: When asked their surnames, the official [who could read and write] would have to guess the spelling. In some cases there are different spellings within the same family. </font></p>

This changed somewhat with my grandfather&rsquo;s family. The family moved from Bishop&rsquo;s Waltham, to Southampton. His oldest son [Edward] immigrated to the States and was in business, his sister, also moved to the States. Louise was a stay at home mother, brother Bert was in Real Estate, Will was owner his own store. Brother George was a groundskeeper, his sister Daisy looked after her parents, Ernie died in WWI, John died at less that a year old, Louise, not sure probably a stay at home mother, and Minnie...the black sheep of the family. And finally Sid, my Dad, started off with the post office, then went to sea as a steward...left just before the war and had a multitude of semi-skilled jobs. He was an excellent provider.</font></font></p>

He was a steward. A steward is a person who is, to all intents and purposes, a servant who makes beds, cleans the rooms (cabins) and tries to make the sea trip for the passenger as comfortable as possible: This career most likely accounts Dad&#39;s habit of grabbing a duster when he came home and perfecting what Mum had already done in the way of housework. It would seem reasonable to believe that this did not do much for Dad&#39;s popularity!! I believe that Dad&#39;s career took him to France, South Africa, South and North America, and possibly Germany.

She obviously picked up something about the finer things of life because like Dad, she had a classy way about her. I know she and Dad wanted the best for us kids. They seemed to realize it took a little class to get on in the world.

I was born in a house belonging to them, Harefield House. The house was still standing when we visited in the late 1980&#39;s. I think Mum must have lived there when she and Dad were first married. You&#39;ll remember my Dad was at sea (not all at, but serving at). Mum and Dad either bought or were given as a wedding present a house in Hedge End. The house was still standing in 1991. Mum and Dad sold it to a family member, Ray Gadsby, and you all received a little of the proceeds. Aunty Edie and Uncle Ern</font><font face="Arial, sans-serif" pbzloc="60"> lived in the house for years.

You would have all liked Uncle Em he was, in my view, the epitome of what the middle class Englishman should be, polite, cheerful, honest to a fault, a fine gentleman. So you can see you come from a long line of rich property owners, ho! ho! ho! I do believe, though, it is that sort of back-ground that decides your course of action throughout life. In this case my grandparents were homeowners, so were my parents, and consequently that was your Mum&rsquo;s and my objective: to own a home. I&#39;m a sure Mum&#39;s parents were the same. Some more on my Mum in service: the person she worked for was I, think, a Judge, and fancy dinners were held and the whole bit. OK for the host and family but a bit of a bind for the hired help. I think Mum worked for some real &#39;twerps&#39;, i.e., head cooks and butlers who were a bit of a bother to work for</font><font face="Arial, sans-serif">. </font></p>

She was quite &#39;handy&#39; and &#39;a clip around the ear&#39;, especially if her wedding ring contacted your head, really got your attention. It made quite an impression. No pun intended. I remember when someone became too big (no names here) a small, wand like cane, was purchased.</font>&nbsp;<font face="Arial, sans-serif" pbzloc="62">It meant Mum could reach further. I distinctly remember her chasing me down the garden path, cane in hand, making contact on at least a couple of occasions. The heinous crime has long been forgotten.

I think Jean had some problems to resolve when Mum died. I&#39;m glad to say, however, a couple of years Jean has kinder memories. Mum used to visit various little old ladies; you just didn&#39;t hop into a car and take off, it meant a trip by bus. So in effect, you just didn&#39;t drop in on a person. It made a daylong trip away from home. </font></p>

You will all remember at times being told you looked like, The Wreck of the Hesperus. Just to fill you in a little, as if you cared! As I recall the ship ran aground or sank not too far from shore, unfortunately the waters were filled with sharks, you can guess the rest. The other, a battle scene: It showed troops all lined up to do battle. Real cheery pictures to eat lunch by! Mrs. Smallwood, a member of the Women&#39;s Voluntary Service, sold savings stamps to help the war effort. That won&#39;t mean anything to you, but I stuck it in because that what she was and did!

I don&#39;t think they saw anything wrong with it. Money was tight; Mother knew best, I had no argument with the setup. I really believe that they were do-ing what they felt was best for all of us kids. I know you probably think you were kept in check; what with pants with maple leaves on them.

No smart remarks about cricket being odd, and soccer, and would try the game of rounders, the original version of baseball She was always stiff the next day. Sex was never discussed around the house, unless in the context that it was the number after five. Mum did give me a book on the &#39;birds and the bees&#39; when I was around 12-13 years of age. I was pitifully ignorant on the subject. However, when I consider today&#39;s &#39;educated values&#39; I&#39;m not sure which was better or worse.

Other ladies smoking did not bother her, but thought that it should be done in the house and not the street. I&#39;m not sure where Mum was from a religious point of view.

She seemed to know a great deal about plants, how to garden. Our garden was always one of the best in the road. As I write this, April 24, 1991, Mum is 83 years old. She is not enjoying the best of health. In the last little while she has had operations on her eyes for cataracts, which, according to my sister Jean&#39;s last letter, were unsuccessful.

But, here is a story of how we met. I was stationed in barracks [Hubbelrath] on the outskirts of Dusseldorf, it was a large settlement and included a Rest and Relaxation centre where food was available. There was an area [I think] that must have provided room to sit and read magazines. I picked up a movie magazine and found there was a section where people could start a pen-pal relationship. Nothing appealed to me on my first reading. The next week an item the caught my eye: A young lady living in Thornhill, Hampshire, some 10 miles [16 km] from where I lived and would be for the duration of my leave. I wrote she wrote, we wrote some more and some more and finally we met in the fall of 1955. </span></font></font></h3>

Don&#39;t ask anymore, I don&#39;t know any more!!&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial, sans-serif">November 27, 1999. Again, I remember very little at this time about Ivan. He was, I believe, more outgoing than me, and rather fancied himself as a ladies man! He also went to Brockenhurst Grammar School. He served his apprenticeship as a carpenter. Then he joined the police service, for the County of Hampshire. He and his wife, Phyl, later headed off to Australia. Alec and Sandra are their children. </font></p>

At the present time we hoping travel back to Jolly Olde and all meet up again. I don&#39;t think we ever had any disagreements, although he was of the opinion that I was number one son with my Mum!! I can&#39;t think why!! </font></p>

Met with Ivan and his wife Phyl there; apparently he was under the impression I had said I was better than him because I was a Christian. Can&#39;t think how that happened: Don&#39;t even remember talking to him about Christian things. However, to cut a long story short, we are now the best of brothers and correspond regularly via e-mail. We played a game of golf in England, he beat me badly, but it was a very enjoyable day spent on the links. </font></p>
