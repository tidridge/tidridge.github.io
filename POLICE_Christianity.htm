It&#39;s just there! A project is planned (Habitat for Humanity?), the group decide what to do; as they carryout their plans they ask Elisha to come along (better not leave the old feller out!). Some one drops an ax into the water. He gripes that it&#39;s someone else&#39;s ax. Tough! Plenty more down at the bazaar!</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">God always has a reason... so Elisha feels sorry for the man (Christian compassion?), carries out the &#39;floating of the ax&#39; (Christian practicality?), tells the man to take out the ax (Christian building up?). Elisha seeks no praise or compensation (Christian humility?).</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">OK, already, so I am stretching the implications but, always remember we may have the opportunity to use compassion, practicality, building up and humility, even if we are old fellers! ... in Jesus&#39; name.</font></font></p>

Let me explain... you are about to &#39;get on parade&#39;, you glance down and you have left the bolt of your rifle (a Lee Enfield 303, yes, I am that old!) on your bed. You can&#39;t leave the parade; you are stuck... this is where &#39;bluffing your way&#39; came into play. </font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">In due time you would lined up with the rest of your company awaiting an inspection by an officer: He would walk the ranks looking for negative things, (occasionally positive things as well!) like dirty boots, unclean brasses etc. As he came to you, you called out your regimental number and your name, and he would inspect you. Now, the art of &#39;bluffing&#39; came into play... It was thought that if you yelled out your name in a positive way it was assumed the officer would give you a brief glance and then move on, depending, of course, how the rest of your turnout was, &#39;missing&#39; the missing bolt. Some 50 years later I have suddenly realized that if you bluffed your way it was most likely not how you called out your name and number but it was due to the officer giving you a break! Maybe!</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">So where am I going on this one... I suggest with respect, that many of us Christians are &#39;bluffing our way&#39; with our faith... we say all the right things but if questioned we would have to &#39;bluff our way&#39; by talking around the topic and unable to give a reason for our beliefs hoping that our great talking would do the trick. Are we educated so that bluffing is not necessary? Comments?</font></font></p>
