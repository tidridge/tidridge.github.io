			<div pbzloc="92" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">JOHN BATHGATE My details : Born lucky on the 12 August 1934 in Southampton. As a boy I went to Eling school whilst living in Causeway Crescent, Totton, and then St Denys school when living at 12 Kent Road Southampton. During this time we endured the 1939-1945 war. We had frequent bombing raids on Southampton and as we lived near a railway bridge we had several bombs land within 100 yards or so of the house. We stayed in an Anderson shelter in the garden during raids. Air raid warnings from sirens were a big nuisance to me, as they meant leaving a cinema to go to the shelter. If the raid was local and the all clear did not sound within 15 minutes then the film show was abandoned. I went to the cinema every week to the Broadway with my Auntie Vera, so I saw every MGM and Warner Brothers films made during the war. My mum would often slip me a shilling to go to other cinemas so that I could catch up with the output from other studios, so long as i took my gas mask.</span></div>

			<div>&nbsp;</div>

			<div style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">I passed the scholarship and went to Taunton&#39;s school in Southampton from 1945 to 1950. This was an excellent boys only grammar school which gave me a first class education. We lived with our back garden running down to the main Southern Railway. I loved the trains and became a &quot;spotter&quot;. I often cycled to Salisbury and Andover to catch &quot;foreign&quot; engines. I also caught the train up to London so that I could wander round the stations of other railways to cop real foreigners.</span></span></div>

			<div style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</div>

			<div style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">I joined the GPO in 1950 as a youth-in training (39 shillings and 6 pence a week) and spent two years on a selection of different telephone engineering jobs. This meant going to Bristol for residential courses. This was fine as Bristol had more cinemas than Southampton and I could see probably eight films a week.</span></span></div>

			<div style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</div>

			<div style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Then in 1952 I was called up to do two years National Service in the RAF. I did my square bashing for eight weeks at Padgate near Warrington, before going on to trade training at Locking near Weston super Mare. I ended up at RAF Lyneham as a ground wireless fitter maintaining the radio transmitters and receivers on the aerodrome. Not a lot happened, I avoided parades by having convenient faults to repair urgently and for most of the time was billeted off the main camp at the transmitting station. We drew rations to cook our own meals and worked a three shift pattern. This left time for me to keep up with current films. I was however bored with the work and was glad to be released from the RAF in 1954.</span></span></div>

			<div style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</div>

			<div style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Returning to St Denys and the GPO, I was employed on telephone exchange construction work around Southampton and Winchester. This was ideal work for me, it suited me exactly. Lots to learn, so it meant a series of training courses at Bristol and Stone. By the late fifties I ended up becoming Clerk of Works on large contractor supplied new exchanges.</span></span></div>

			<div style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</div>

			<div style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">However early in this period on the 21st December 1954 at an evening Christmas party at the main Ogle Road telephone exchange, I met Jean. We hit it off immediately and became a couple straight away. Our first date included beans on toast at Charlie Wayman&#39;s cafe at the Junction in Southampton. I also attended the Christmas Eve midnight service at Eling church with Jean&#39;s family. At that time of night, I had my first bike ride back to St Denys.</span></span></div>

			<div style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</div>

			<div style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Jean&#39;s father was a bit old fashioned and rationed our meetings to Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday and Jean had to be home by ten. This wrecked my cinema going career as we could only go together on a Saturday. Sunday was out as no well brought up lady went to a Sunday cinema show.</span></span></div>

			<div style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</div>

			<div style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">When we decided to get married, we also decided to save first and buy our own house. In the end we saved &pound;400 to put down on a &pound;1995 bungalow at West End, Southampton. We were married on the first of March 1958 at Eling church with a reception provided by Jean&#39;s mother, Ethel, in the parish hall. We went straight to our new bungalow for the honeymoon, having hired a Ford Anglia for days out. Our next door neighbours were Les and Christine who remained our friends. Chris died and Les remarried to Linda and they now also, by chance, live in Lydney close to us.</span></span></div>

			<div style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</div>

			<div style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">John was born in 1960 and Mike in 1962. We had bought our first car, a 1947 Standard Vanguard, and so we went on holidays to the Isle of Wight.</span></span></div>

			<div style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</div>

			<div style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">At work, I was taken off Clerk of the Works duties in 1964 and put onto Internal Planning. Not so interesting but I was then recommended for promotion, took the board and passed and spent six months based in Taunton visiting all the various telephone groups. Who gets training like that nowadays? In the end I was given a new post in Bristol on External Planning. We moved to Wick on the last day of 1964.</span></span></div>

			<div style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</div>

			<div style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">I spent a few months in the Bristol office and was then moved to Bath to take over the group planning the rerouting of the external cables to the new Kingsmead exchange. I think it was time to be thrown in at the deep end, but I had lovely staff who made sure I didn&#39;t do anything too stupid. The exchange went into service with no problem. I joined the Bath planners skittles team and then played for them for 41 seasons until the team broke up.</span></span></div>

			<div style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</div>

			<div style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">I thoroughly enjoyed external planning as it had everything. Laying out a cable network, economics, liaising with surveyors, builders, farmers and the public. Even Jean enjoyed a day out in the sun surveying decayed poles for renewal. I ended up moving back to the Bristol office to plan the big cables that ran between exchanges.</span></span></div>

			<div style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</div>

			<div style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Meanwhile the children went to the primary school in Wick followed by the comprehensive in Cadbury Heath, Bristol. John went on to university in Pontypridd, Wales. Jean started to work part time as a clerk with a firm that made shoes. There she made friends with Sylvia, who with her husband Derek, have remained good friends with us. Holidays went a bit further afield to the various Channel Islands. Later she rejoined BT as a telephone accounts clerk.</span></span></div>

			<div style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</div>

			<div style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">In 1974 I was further promoted to Executive Engineer but this time I did not have to move again. I took over the Business customer engineering planning and coordination and the several Stores in the Bristol area. This gave me a staff of over 100 to deal with and was a different sort of work. I was asked to train my planners in external work so that we could take over the entire networks on the very biggest sites, eg aerodromes. I had just the right experience for that sort of work and thoroughly enjoyed running the group. During the 70s we started to holiday in Scotland, gradually going further and further north. We now visit northern Scotland a couple of times a year as we have become friends with Christine who lives in Reiff, a hamlet on the coast looking out over the Minch to the Outer Hebrides. The islands appear on the horizon on clear days.</span></span></div>

			<div style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</div>

			<div style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">As the 80s started, the demand for &quot;private circuits&quot; became phenomenal and my other work was gradually stripped away so that I could become the Bristol Area&#39;s Private Service Manager. This still left me with around 130 excellent staff.</span></span></div>

			<div style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</div>

			<div style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 16px"><span pbzloc="98" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Life in the 80s was excellent. Margaret Thatcher upset a lot of people but for Jean and I, she was fine. It was a decade of fine dining and better holidays. It was in 1980 that Jean suggested that we go white water rafting on the Colorado in the USA. This was a hugely memorable holiday as the four day trip turned into a bit of a disaster from the weather point of view. We should have slept on the river bank under the stars but instead huddled packed under a tarpaulin sheltering as far as possible from torrential rain. The rapids were easy compared with the weather. We did meet Barbara from Texas who became our very good friend and still is to this day. Having broken the ice we have always regarded America as the best place to holiday and have now visited 35 states.</span></span></div>

			<div style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</div>

			<div style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">In 1986 we decided to move &quot;over the bridge&quot; to Tintern in Wales. At the same time BT reorganised and I had to take over the private circuit staff in the Gloucester area. The work load became ridiculous, I did not enjoy this, so when early retirement was offered to any fifty people in the new District, I jumped at the chance. So in December 1988, I left work with a good pension. Jean resigned at the same time.</span></span></div>

			<div style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</div>

			<div style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">We stayed in Tintern until 2007. During that time we integrated into village life, making a big circle of new friends. I published the Parish News and became treasurer of the Village Produce Association and Jean became Show secretary. We continued to holiday in America and Scotland and eventually added Serbia and Croatia to our favoured spots following our son John&#39;s decision to move to Novi Sad in Serbia.</span></span></div>

			<div style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</div>

			<div style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">We both had cancers during this time but we were both treated successfully. Life was fine in Tintern but eventually Jean decided our garden was too much to handle as it was large and on a slope with 39 steps from bottom to top.</span></span></div>

			<div style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</div>

			<div style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">I had joined the Dean Forest heritage railway as a telecoms volunteer so we decided to move to Lydney, nearer the railway. We managed this in 2007 and now have a small house with a lovely small garden in the middle of town. Lydney is a busy small town with all the facilities very close to us. The Forest of Dean is on our doorstep and the railway is under a mile away. I run a small team looking after the &quot;comms&quot; on the railway. We have three electro-mechanical heritage telephone exchanges to play with, and a fourth under construction. Jean has joined the gardening team and they also look after the second hand book store and they pack and send out the railway&#39;s magazine.</span></span></div>

			<div style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</div>

			<div style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">I started by saying I was lucky. This is true, I had the right parents, the right school, the right job, the right friends but mostly I married the right girl and had good children and grandchildren.</span></span></div>

Their address was 43 Parker&#39;s Avenue, Wick, Bristol. The children went to school, firstly in the village school at Wick and then at the Sir Bernard Lovell School at Oldland Common. John worked in Bath and Bristol.</font></font></p>

This was a downsize in houses and a real change in that they now live in the centre of a small but busy town in the Forest of Dean. Both now spend a lot of time as volunteers at the local Forest of Dean Steam Railway. Jean works with a friend mainly as a gardener looking after the flowers etc at four stations on the line and John works with the Electrical and Telecom group. Funnily enough, their friend Les of fifty years, also lives in Lydney with his second wife, Linda.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Jean and John spent holidays in their early married life within the UK and the Channel Islands. The West Coast of Scotland has remained a regular feature of their holiday schedule, (see <a href="http://www.reiffcottages.co.uk"><font color="#0066cc">www.reiffcottages.co.uk</font></a> for the favourite spot). Trips have been taken to Europe but not to any regular extent. However son, John, moved to live in Serbia in 2005 and there have been several visits to that country since. John lives in Novi Sad, the second city of Serbia. This is an interesting city on the Danube and visits there are always very enjoyable. In 1980, they went to the USA for the first time and on a white water rafting trip on the Colorado, met <b>Babs</b> from Texas who has remained a firm friend ever since. There have now been many trips to America, often going via Texas. Other American relatives and friends have also been visited over the last twenty years. The USA is now the holiday of preference.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: left"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Dear <b>John and Jean</b>,</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Firstly, may I congratulate you both on your input to this most successful web site..</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Reading your life histories, there are two periods when our paths may have crossed.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><b>John</b>, we note that you lived at St. Denys as a child. <b>Marion</b> did also - at 92, Priory Road, which is situated opposite the end of Ivy Road. She does not recall you, and as you are five years older than her, it is probable that you never met. She has an elder brother <b>John</b>, born in 1935, who went to King Edwards school. Ring any bells ? The family were evacuated to Bransgore in the New Forest for the war years. Know any girls from the village, <b>Jean</b>, who went to Brockenhurst Grammar ?</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Secondly, I note that you spent your early married years at West End. Did you, or perhaps your friends there, ever meet my father, <b>Paul</b>, who taught at the school there between 1946 and 1974 ? He died in 1983. He used to be in charge of the school sport, and several years ago, I donated a load of photographs of him with the various cricket and football teams over the years to the West End museum. The school is no more.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Finally, here is another coincidence for you. Although the <b>MAIDMENTs</b> in the 1930&#39;s were a Southampton family, in 1934 my father accepted a job in Bristol. I was born there in 1935 at Ashton Gate, in a house which more or less backed onto the City football ground. I was christened at the well known St. Mary Redcliffe church. The job did not work out, and by 1938 we were back in Southampton. </font></font></p>

			<p style="text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">We await your reply with great interest.</font></font></p>

Bedford had thoughtfully allowed the starter to be accessible from inside, useful in the cold weather. We converted the Workabus to a caravan and took the family everywhere.</span></span></p>

It had to be small, cheap and economical. We succeeded, we bought a two cylinder <b>NSU Prince</b>. In the rain this became a single cylinder car despite packing the two coils into plastic bags. It also needed the head to be removed every 18 thousand. &quot;They&#39;re all the same, it&#39;s quite normal&quot; I was told by the garage. Any ham handed mechanic could strip the plug threads. Mine had both cylinders fitted with coil inserts by the time it left home.</span></span></p>

My son did wonder if I ought to go down to a single cylinder diesel dumper. However I went up in the world to a three cylinder two stroke <b>Wartburg</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was fine to drive. The freewheel allowed clutchless changes once the car was rolling. It went like a bomb, those following would agree as they smelt the burning oil. This car was removed from my life when my eldest son came back from university having passed his driving test. It finished life being rolled over and over after being struck at traffic lights. Every panel was pushed in but my son got just one cut from a spade loose in the back of the car. He arrived home with a door handle in his hand wondering if I wanted to know where the rest of my car was.</span></span></p>

This had only three wheels. It was a <b>Bond Bug 700ES</b>. What a lovely little vehicle. Very comfortable to drive. Super performance in the dry, but lethal cornering in the wet. I wish it still lived in my garage. Probably the most fun we had in a car. Its only vice was that it needed a new catch to fix down the lifting roof every year but made up for this by only needing &pound;5 spent if the silencer needed replacement.</span></span></p>

The Midget was three years old, in perfect condition with only 9111 miles on the clock. The boot looked as though it had never been opened and the passenger seat had obviously never had anything heavier than a handbag on it. The Midget had to earn its living for quite a few years as it was our only car. It went to work every day, down to visit Southampton every three weeks or so, and all over the country on holiday. During its life it has been white, green and red.</span></span></p>

Bringing it home from Newport to Tintern took over 40 miles on the clock. Next day it was over 40 miles to Bristol. I found that I had bought a car with an odometer that recorded in kilometres. It wasn&#39;t a bad little car but suffered just like the NSU. Rain on the motorway reduced the ignition to nearly useless. Going up the slope on the M4 to the Almonsbury interchange could tell me what the humidity was like that day. If it was dry and fine I could top the hill at 60, if it was humid I could manage 50, if it was pouring with rain it was hard shoulder and hazard flasher time.</span></span></p>

I bought a big boot. It belonged to a <b>Ford Orion</b>. I didn&#39;t get on with this car. The boot was big but the sill was too high. The steering strained every muscle. The repair bills strained the credit card limits. I was glad when I was told not to try to get the car through another MOT. The rust heap went to my son for the remaining time on its MOT but he managed to get it through one last time and it spent its last year away from me behaving itself</span></span></p>

She said &quot;yes&quot;. A friend had a <b pbzloc="252">Nissan Micra Auto</b> for sale. I bought it and now I have been driven home from skittles in Bath many times. The Micra and the Midget co-existed for some time, the Midget getting the garage as it was there first and is now getting on in years. The Micra sat on the drive and kept an eye on the Midget. I think they got on fine. Eventually the Midget went too far and required &pound;598 spent on a service. I told it off and said it was time to leave home. This worried my youngest son who was horrified at the thought of the Midget leaving the family. We struck a deal and now it resides in his garage instead. My son and his wife went to town cleaning it up until it looked as good as it has done for years but the Midget simply repayed them by demanding a new clutch and thrust bearing.<br />
			The Micra went to 133,000 miles and seemed in good heart, but then we spent a lot of money getting it through the MOT and it promptly gave up on its head gasket. No one wanted a car for nothing with a new head gasket needed so it had to go to the dump. It had served us well and was the most reliable car we had ever had.</span></span></p>

He talked the price down by &pound;500 and gave me a ring. Two days later it was ours. It served us well and was as reliable as its predecessor</span></span></p>
