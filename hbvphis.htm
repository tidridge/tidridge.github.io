The Pack was formed in the 1950&#39;s under the leadership of Ken Jenkyns who later had helpers Walter Rideout and Bob [?] McVee. The group was sponsored by the then Highlands Baptist Church and was an &#39;open&#39; group meaning any lad who wanted to join could... The group closed in the early 1970&#39;s when the church embarked on another youth program, Brigade Boys.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Tidridge began his term in 1961 and lasted[?] until 1971. He had been nodding his head politely as his wife and a friend were talking...he realized later that he had volunteered to help with the cub pack. It became obvious after a couple of meetings the 2 leaders had reached the end of their tether and wanted out. Bob McVee did stay on for a while though. In addition to Traynor and Twigg, Glen Holland helped for several years and also Fred Coffey. The late Mike Dronyk came to camp with us... and made excellent early morning coffee... he was a Transit operator at the time and 5.30 morning start was old hat to him. </font></font></p>

Eventually the women forgave him when he was able to make his case clearer! He wanted the dad&#39;s involved. Having said that no group runs without the help of the parents and supporters. The Weetmans, Nowickis, Hewkos, McPhersons, Prices [Earl typed the Newsletter] , Welshs, James&#39;, Mr. Foth who supplied excellent bedding plants for fund raising, ...and the list could on.... There were bottle drives [eliminated because people might get the wrong impression with the assorted pop and other types of bottles stored [for a very short period of time] in the pastor&#39;s garage, wire coat hangers drives... </font></font></p>

For those interested the stripes on the left arm recognized a leadership role... 1 stripe a seconder, 2 stripes a sixer...these two lads were to work together to supervise a six of, yes 6 boys. The senior sixer had 3 stripes. It might be said by some, the cubs were run on a military concept... no argument there!</font></font></p>

There were 2 trips to camp at Skeleton Lake, various prized for being the best six [a sub-grouping in the Pack]. Prized included a trip in the Police private aircraft,trips to the Police station, a local radio station, the water cleansing plant, electrical safety and a couple of Jamborees [ a gathering of all the local Packs for an evening of games and skill testing.. the list goes on! Guest speakers were called in and gave interesting talks...the police canine unit came, a First Nations chief spoke to us...</font></font></p>

To those in the know the seemingly gibberish words signalled yet another opening of a cub pack meeting. Groups met in any hall where they were sponsored. What do they mean?
