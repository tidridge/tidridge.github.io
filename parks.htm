<p><center><b>INTRODUCTION</b></center></p>
<p>My interest in the commemorative benches in the Highlands and Bellevue communities was aroused as I noticed them and then as I either wrote or encouraged other people to write, about the benches they had had erected for departed loved one.</p>
<p>It seemed to me there also had to something of interest in the history of the parks as well. I hope you find what I found interesting.</p>
<p>With the exception of one picture scanned from an article, all the photos are the author's; the articles from which information was gleaned have come from various sources but mainly from the City of Edmonton Community Service (thanks to Darrell Nordell for his help) and the City Archives, particularly Paula Aurini-Onderwater, where the staff is always polite and helpful.</p>
<p>In the Community Newsletter, first time around, the articles included pictures of the benches, this time; however, pictures will show what can be seen from the bench, that apart from sitting on is the purpose of the bench, surely! Words on the plaques will be included.</p> 
<p>What also came to mind, as I visited the sites, was how blessed our two communities are with parks and benches (there are other benches as well as the commemorative ones). The sites are well maintained, and, obviously readily accessible, without charge. We should make better use of these facilities!</p>

<p><b>How to secure a Commemorative Bench</b></p>
<p>Steps in commemorating a special person or event under the City of Edmonton Benchmark Program include completing a data form, having the plan approved, providing script for a plaque and paying the cost of plaque and any bench refurbishing. Tax-deductible receipts are issued, and profits help preserve and develop city green spaces. For more information, call 311.</p>
<p></p>A different and longer process is required to name a park but the process begins with a call to 311.

<p><b>The Callas Bench</b>
<br>(South of Ada Boulevard and west of 62 Street)</p>

<p><b>Bench along Ada recalls James Callas</b><br> 
by  Art Hnatiuk and Elaine Callas</p>
<p>The families of James Callas and Wendy Hnatiuk chose a spot on Ada Boulevard at 62 Street, halfway between the Hyde family home on 64 Street and the Callas family home on 58 Street, to place a bench in memory of these two wonderful people.</p> 
<img src="park03.jpg" width=200 height=150 vspace=5 hspace=5 align=left alt="looking ahead">
<p>Wendy (Hyde) Hnatiuk (1948-2001) was the daughter of John and Myrte Hyde, longtime Highland's residents. John Hyde and his brothers, Ralph and Bob, grew up in their family home on 61 Street.</p> 
<p>James Callas (1943-1996) was the son of Nick and Ethel Callas. After losing her husband, Ethel moved her family to the Highlands in the mid-50s and still lives in the house today.</p> 
<p>Having enjoyed walks along Ada Boulevard on many summer and fall afternoons, our families could not resist having the bench turned inwards towards the street so that the beautiful homes and colourful trees lining the street could be enjoyed by anyone sitting and resting there.</p> 
<p>Our families lost Jim just over nine years ago and Wendy four years ago, each at the premature age of 53. We carried on alone until Oct. 15, three years ago, when Wendy's husband Arthur Hnatiuk married Jim's wife Elaine Callas. Wendy's children Colleen and Geoff (and grandchildren Tassa and Giovanni) plus Jim's daughter Pamela, Elaine and Art have created one huge family: five grandparents, 12 siblings and their 10 spouses, 16 nieces and nephews and three great nieces and nephews. 
<img src="park04.jpg" width=200 height=133 vspace=5 hspace=5 align=left alt="looking west">
On behalf of all of our enormous new family, we express the hope that many people will stop and rest at Jim and Wendy's bench and enjoy the scenery at this lovely spot in the Highlands.</p> 
<p>The Callas bench does indeed offer a different view from the other benches that will be mentioned. Of course, the first thing you should notice as you sit on the bench is the Holgate Mansion, once being the home of the co-founder and developer of the Highlands area. The house has always been well maintained and is one of the homes visitors to the boulevard seek out to view.</p>
<p>As one looks to the west several homes can be seen, including a bit of the Magrath Mansion.</p> 
<img src="park05.jpg" width=200 height=111 vspace=10 hspace=10 align=right alt="looking east">
<p>To the east a turreted and interesting look-ing home, well landscaped and a show place in the area.</p> 
<p>The bench is also a unique 'people watching spot', the bench is set far enough back from the edge of the roadway to be 'discreetly' placed, but close enough for anyone sitting there to view those passing by; whether on foot, bicycle or vehicle, some as singles, some as families some with dogs and others without. The bench is shaded and offers a place of respite if you so choose or a scene of activity! It's your choice.</p><hr>
<p><b>The KLOSE BENCH<br>
(South of Ada Boulevard at 75 Street)</b></p>
<img src="park06.jpg" width=700 height=283 vspace=5 hspace=5 align=absmiddle alt="Klose plaque">
<p><b>A sons' tribute: the Charlotte and Theodore Klose Bench.</b></p> 
<p>It is a difficult task for me to encapsulate in a few sentences the lives of my mother and father, Charlotte and Theodore Klose, and at the same time paint a picture of what the Highlands area meant to them and how much they loved being there. Indeed, we decided on dedicating a bench to their memory at Ada Blvd. and 76 Street because they always cherished that stunning view of what must surely be one of the most beautiful cityscapes in Canada. I might add that even during their last illnesses, both of my parents refused to leave their home to live in a seniors' residence somewhere else in the city.</p> 
<p>Between them, my parents lived in the area for approximately 134 years. My mother was born in 1917, and except for ten years in the 1940's when the Klose family moved to Vancouver, she lived here all her life. She was raised in the house her family built at 7511 112 Avenue. At that time, it was one of the few houses in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Her father, Dr. Paul Karrer (d. 1933) was a prominent Swiss-born dentist whose office was in the Tegler Building. He and the Karrer family were popular members of the Edelweiss club for many years. Charlotte's stepfather was Herman Brettel, who at age 17 was a First World War pilot with von Richtoven's Flying Circus. Her uncle was Dr. Paul Karrer (Zurich, d. 1971), who won the 1937 Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research in vitamins. </p>
<p>Theodore Klose (d. 2002) was born in 1909 and arrived in Canada from Germany in 1926. His first years in Edmonton were a struggle, exacerbated by limited knowledge of English. Eventually, he became co-owner and superintendent of the Norwood Foundry. After retiring in 1972, he started a new career as a professional cabinetmaker, which he very much enjoyed. During this period, he and Charlotte built a cabin on Wabamun Lake where they spent many happy summers. Both were excellent amateur musicians: he played the piano and she the violin. I remember many wonderful musical evenings at home. </p>
<p>Charlotte and Ted met at the Edelweiss Club and married in 1939. They had two sons: Robert, who now resides in Edmonton, and Ronald, who lives in Brandon.

<img src="park07.jpg" width=200 height=110 vspace=5 hspace=5 align=left alt="downtown view">
<p>The view from the Klose bench is quite 'over-powering' as you overlook a strong stand of fir and deciduous trees for as far as the eye can see; until looking slightly to the west you are caught up in the ever-growing skyline of the city.</p>
<img src="park08.jpg" width=200 height=150 vspace=5 hspace=5 align=right alt="looking east">
<p>The bench is nestled in a quiet spot, although clearly seen from Ada and 75 Street, is still offers a place of solitude.</p>
<p>It is hard to tie the east and west views together. The one to the east is accentuated by the stark (Group of Seven?)  dead tree; ignoring the tree though, the landscape if peaceful and serene.</p> 
<p>The lack of a people-watching post is compensated for by the view(s)!</p>
<p>A fitting tribute to well loved parents.</p><hr>
<p><b>THE SINGER BENCH</b>
<br>Ada Boulevard west of 65 Street-in the Henry Martell Park)</p>
<img src="park09.jpg" width=700 height=283 vspace=5 hspace=5 align=absmiddle alt="Singer Plaque">
<p><b>The Singer Bench</b>
<br>By Alison Singer-Graham and John Tidridge</p>
<p>Have you noticed the bench nestled in the northeast corner of the park at Ada Boulevard and 65 Street, now aptly named the Henry Martell Park? Have you wandered off the beaten track to read the memorial plaque fixed to the back? You didn't know about the bench or the plaque? That's a shame, because in both winter and summer the bench offers a tranquil spot to "sit and ponder". (In winter you may have to wear snow boots to reach it, then brush off the snow.) Sitting here, surrounded by trees and shrubs, you face southwest across the park, feeling the peace. And now a little history provided by Alison, wife of the late John Singer.</p> 
<p>The Ash House, (6256-Ada Boulevard) was purchased by Philip and Matilda Singer in 1930. The Singers raised nine children: Katherine, Albert, Edward, Clarence, Mary, Clara, Helen and John, Alison's late husband. Alison said the children were brought up in a family of "faith, hope and love." The home remained in the family until 1976.</p>
<p>When Alison asked Community Services to install the bench, she was unaware that the park would be called Henry Martell Park. She thought it appropriate, however, because her father-in-law was one of the first contributors to the Highlands Golf Course.</p>
<p>For John, the conversation was a tying together of some loose ends. The name Kyle (mentioned on the plaque) rang a bell as being connected to the big white house on the Boulevard and to a Ken who served as a wolf cub dad back in the '60's. Turns out that daughter Helen and son-in-law Ken Kyle, subsequent to John's (Singer's) marriage, lived with Mrs. Matilda Singer in the "big white house".</p> 
<p>The bench is a fitting memorial to a Highlands family. And now you know (some of) the rest of the story.</p>
<img src="park10.jpg" width=250 height=188 vspace=5 hspace=5 align=left alt="looking west">
<p>For those of us who know of the Singer Bench and Martell Park may say when asked, what can you see from the bench? Our answer might be, if we have never sat on the bench, the golf course: but we would be wrong!! You can see nothing of the golf course, unless you count the big white house where another famous local golf lived!</p>
<img src="park11.jpg" width=250 height=188 vspace=5 hspace=5 align=right alt="looking east">
<p>The bench itself sits toward the northeast corner of the park. It is very well shaded but still offers a good view of Ada Boulevard and it its users.</p> 
<p>The photo above shows what you see if you sit straight on the bench, then, if you crane your neck and look to the east, you again view a park-like boulevard with several different types of trees.</p>
<p>The bench is situated surrounded by trees, and it provides a cool spot to sit and view.</p><br clear=all><hr>
<p><b>THE UNWIN BENCH</b><br> 
(South side of Ada Boulevard between 53 and 55 Streets)</p>
<img src="park12.jpg" width=700 height=251 vspace=5 hspace=5 align=absmiddle alt="the Unwin plaque">
<p>On December 5, 1998, my mother, Maureen Unwin, passed away almost 50 years to the day after she and my father moved into our brand new home in the Highlands. Mum did not want a memorial service or funeral or any fuss made over her. We wanted to honour her memory and found what we felt was the perfect way to do that.</p> 
<p>We discovered that the City of Edmonton's Benchmark Program offers an opportunity to commemorate special events and honour loved ones through the purchase of a park bench. By making a donation to the program, we were able to replace the existing bench on 55 street and Ada Boulevard with a new one, on which the City has placed a bronze plaque that reads: </p>	 	 
<p><center>In loving memory
<br>From the family and friends
<br>of Maureen and Jack Unwin
<br>"Finding comfort together,
<br>the way old friends do".</center></p>
<p>On Sunday June 20, 1999, thanks in no small part to Mum's friends, many of whom are long-time Highlands residents, we dedicated the bench in memory of both my parents.</p> 
<p>My sister Judy spoke for all of us when she said, 'We hope this will not only be a tribute to our parents but also a way to give back to the community and the city that they both loved. The view from the bench is of the downtown, the magnificent river and the peaceful and scenic Highlands golf course. We hope the bench will be enjoyed by lovers and friends, young and old".</p> 
<p>We take great comfort in sitting on the bench ourselves but also in seeing others enjoying the view. We encourage others to consider this unique way of paying tribute to someone they love and at the same time adding to the beauty of this wonderful neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The Unwin bench appears to the oldest commemorative bench in the Highlands-Bellevue area.</p>  
<img src="park13.jpg" width=250 height=188 vspace=5 hspace=5 align=left alt="the view to the east">
<p>The bench offers an imposing view of parts of the Highlands golf course and is close enough to hear the comments of the golfer: this may not necessarily be beneficial! The view is spectacular, and conveniently divided by a huge deciduous tree that grows just down the bank from the bench.</p>
<img src="park14.jpg" width=250 height=188 vspace=5 hspace=5 align=right alt="the westerly look">
<p>The west half of the view shows trees, the golf course and just a smidgeon of the North Saskatchewan River. A look to the east will reveal more trees and one can ignore the view of the petroleum industry on the horizon.</p>
<img src="park15.jpg" width=250 height=188 vspace=5 hspace=5 align=right alt="erosion in front of the bench">
<p>As an aside: the author found the drop-off from the base of the bench to be quite severe, possibly caused by erosion, and has reported this to 'the authorities'. While not quite a dodderer he was almost unnerved by the situation. The authorities have responded and will correct the situation.</p>

 <p><b>Borden Park</b><br>
(Earlier known as the East End City Park - 1906)<br> 
(Approved as Borden Park September 9, 1919)<br>
(7507- Borden Park Road NW- covers 20.3 ha or more or less depending on the account you read)</p>
<p><b>Borden Park</b><br>
<i>(It would appear you have your choice of several dates for the various namings!)</i><br>
Material supplied by Community Services, City of Edmonton)</p>
<p>Originally known as the East End City Park, this public park was established in 1906.  After a visit to Edmonton by Canada's eighth Prime Minister, Sir Robert Borden, in 1914, the name of the park was changed to Borden Park.  The park has been a popular destination for Edmontonians over the past century.</p>
<p>Sundays at the park once drew crowds of up to 7,000 people for picnics, baseball, cricket  and of course, the amusements.  Several amusement rides were added to the park in 1915, including a carousel, roller coaster, and tunnel of love.  The giant wooden roller coaster, known as "The Green Rattler", operated until it was dismantled in 1935.  Another popular attraction was "The Old Mill", a tunnel of love that was destroyed by fire in the 1930's.  
<img src="park18.jpg" width=250 height=188 vspace=5 hspace=5 align=right alt="The Swimming Pool">
One of Edmonton's first pools opened here in 1924, offering change rooms, lifeguards, and risqué "mixed bathing" (men and women swimming in the same pool).</p>
<p>In 1929 a tea room was opened in the park.  Borden Park was also the location of Edmonton's first zoo, which included a monkey house, a bear pit, and a coyote cage, among other animals.  Construction on a band shell began in 1955, and the park became a popular destination for music lovers to enjoy a sunny Sunday afternoon listening to one of the many area bands, from school bands to local music scene favorites Tacoy Ryde.</p>
<img src="park17.jpg" width=250 height=188 vspace=5 hspace=5 align=left alt="The Swimming Pool">
<p>Once 148 acres in size, the park has lost land over the years to developments in the area, particularly the expansion of the exhibition grounds at Northlands.</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>BORDEN PARK, named in honour of Sir Robert Laird Borden (1854-1937), the eighth prime minister of Canada, has been an important Edmonton attraction for almost 100 years. In the early part of the last century, as many as 7,000 people would pour into the park on a Sunday to enjoy picnics, baseball and music. Originally known as East End City Park, it was established in 1906. The 21.99-ha. park was renamed following Prime Minister Borden's visit to Edmonton in 1914. Borden was elected prime minister in 1911 and held office until his retirement in 1920.</p> 
<img src="park19.jpg" width=250 height=188 vspace=5 hspace=5 align=right alt="One of several fountains">
<p>One of the city's first three swimming pools was situated in Borden Park. As the Edmonton Journal noted in an article published on September 20, 1924: "The whole pool radiates good humor and innocent enjoyment, and is a fitting reply to those prudes who elevate their eyes to high heaven and deplore the 'wickedness' embodied in mixed bathing." The East End swimming pool, the article continued "will go a long way towards building up a healthy, vigorous, graceful and clean-minded womanhood." In addition to the pool, the park was for many years home to the Edmonton Zoo. Among its first animals was a bear cub named Louise. As well, there were two buffalo, two elk, monkeys, coyotes and peacocks. Other park attractions were a tea room and rides, including a carousel, a giant roller coaster and a tunnel-of-love. The latter, in a bow to decorum, was known as "the Old Mill."</p> 
<img src="park20.jpg" width=250 height=188 vspace=5 hspace=5 align=left alt="Lovely trees">
<p>By the mid-1930's, however, the Old Mill had been destroyed by fire and the rides were showing their age. The massive roller coaster, built in 1915 at a cost of $15,000, was dismantled in 1935 and its timbers salvaged by a lumber company. Borden Park has continued to be an important outdoor venue for Edmontonians, though the attractions offered have changed somewhat since its establishment almost a century ago. In the late 1970s, the park's bandshell hosted performances by two of the city's new-wave rock bands, The Silent Movies and Smarties.</p> 
<p><i>(From material supplied by the City of Edmonton Archives)</i></p>
<p>In 1957, the author arrived in Edmonton and Borden Park still had the zoo. He is quite sure most people who saw the rather wretched display were ashamed of it and shed no tears when it finally closed. When the zoo opened the best of intentions may have been evident, but one would guess by the mid-fifties its time was over and it was rightfully closed. Many hours were spent in the park with his growing family, visiting the concession, the pool and later the grandstand. Again, this park is a valuable asset to the area.</p>
<p>Others have enjoyed ball games at the diamond at the east end of the park and a 'ratttling' good game of tennis on the courts just north of the diamond. During the summer the "Corporate Games" make use of the spacious area. Water plays a part in the park, with a paddling pool near the bandstand; a fountain in an area south of the swimming pool, and yet another paddling pool closer to 112 Avenue. Several areas dedicated for  children.  Each area contains  modern equipment.</p> 
<img src="park21.jpg" width=250 height=188 vspace=5 hspace=5 align=right alt="Even more trees">
<p>Of course the park contains trees and the author had  he would merely say the (Name) Park has lots of lovely trees. But that becomes repetitive if there are too many parks! Darrell Nordell, Community Services, City of Edmonton, saved his hide, as it were, and provided information on the trees in not only Borden Park but many of the others.. The list was of a survey taken in 2007 and showed there were at least 19 varieties of trees and shrubs in the park, including but not limited to, blue spruce (most), elm, ash, pines, maples, prunus, larch, linden, poplar, malus, hawthorn, birch, willow, olive, fir, sorbus apple, mayday, Bur oak Ohio buckeye and juniper! Recent (2008./2009) will have reduced the total to some extent. The total number of trees is over 1300.</p><br clear=all><hr>

<p><b><center>THE SMITH RESIDENCE.<br>
11243-58 Street
Big brown house returned to character of Edwardian gentility after years of work</center></b></p>
<p>Article by David Brooks from the Highlands Historical Society Newsletter Vol.  4 No. 2 Fall 1993</p>
<p>It is truly an experience to be able to talk with family members who can recount 80 years of living in the same house. The author sincerely thanks the Martells, senior and junior, the Craig family, and the Wheelers, for reminiscences. (Permission granted to use)</p>
<p>Stroll north on 60 th/58 th Street from 112 th Avenue and you'll notice a house that seems to be out of place in a sea of post-Second World War residences. The home was built in 1912, but apparently sat vacant until Clyde and Minnie Smith bought it in 1918. A photo taken in the 1940's shows it to be not so much out of place, as pretty well out of town.</p> 
<p>To the north and east the photo shows a wall shows a wall of poplar and willow bush with no sign of neighbors. (The closest were at 61 st Street and 113 th Avenue.)</p> 
<p>There's a small barn hidden away in the back, and a large vegetable garden. The Smiths kept a cow named Buttercup and a flock of chickens. The "spread" eventually became known as Buttercup Farm .</p>  
<p>Clyde Smith held Edmonton's #1 auctioneer's licence for many years. Francis, one of the Smith's daughters, still lives close by, at 11227 -61 St. (The other children were Doris, Olive and Walter nicknamed Benny) Francis'son, Clyde Martell, lives with wife Maureen and son Scott at 11136 -61 St. Francis left the area in 1939 when she married policeman Henry Martell. But they moved back in 1942 into a suite in the Magrath Mansion coach house on 111 th Avenue while they built their new home at 11227 -61 Street. Officer Martell later became the first full-time golf pro at the Highlands course. Francis says that her grandparents, Gillan and Mary Armstrong also arrived in the Highlands in 1918 and resided at 11216 -60 Street, the present home of Jack Thomas and family.</p> 
<p>When Clyde and Minnie Smith moved out of the big brown house at 11243 -58 Street in 1942, the Craig family - Herb and Bessie, with daughters Jean, Phyllis and Carol - moved right in. The girls attended nearby Highlands and Eastwood schools. Phyllis still lives in Edmonton, Carol resides in St. Albert, and Jean lives in Grenada, in the West Indies. Bessie Craig lives in a high-rise on Saskatchewan Drive, with a distant view of her former neighborhood.</p> 
<p>The Wheeler family bought the house in 1962. Gordon Wheeler was 13 years old at the time. He later acquired the family home, and lives there with wife Vicki and daughters Chelsea and Brianne.</p>
<p>Over the past few years the Wheelers have been up to their necks in renovations work, including all new plumbing and wiring. Gordon notes that one of the original fuses controlled just one outlet, while the adjacent one handled 24!</p>
<p>Water in the early days came from an outside well. And a large cistern in the basement collected the rainwater from the downspouts, which was then hand-pumped to the kitchen sink.</p> 
<p>The Wheelers have done much scraping to remove layers of enamel paint from fine old fir casings and other woodwork.</p> 
<p>The house interior today would feel very much like the original "Buttercup Farm" of the Smiths: the dark stained fir window casings and ceiling beams in the dining room, the immaculate dark oak fireplace mantle and surround, and the precisely balanced sliding panel doors between dining and living rooms all maintain the original character of Edwardian gentility in the house.</p> 
<p>The buttressed brick foundation walls appear as sound as they were in the summer of 1912, and if you proceed through the door in the south wall you'll find yourself in a short stairwell right inside the attached garage with the family van hovering just above your head!</p>
<p>The present exterior of the house is very little changed when compared with early photos. The old shed-roofed garage is gone, replaced by one in keeping with the character and detailing of the original house.</p>
<p>The big brown house has been home to just three families in its 81 years, but the methods of escape employed by the children are similar.</p>
<p>On warm summer nights, Gordon Wheeler sometimes went out through the back bedroom balcony and down the clothesline pole for an evening of freedom. The Craig girls left via the south bedroom windows, climbed onto the old shed-garage roof and then made a short jump to the ground - and a night on the town.</p>
<img src="park22.jpg" width=700 height=370 vspace=5 hspace=5 align=absmiddle alt="Buttercup Farm Park plaque">
<p><b>The Park:</b> The Park is not very big but it provides a couple of benches and a variety of evergreen, deciduous trees and shrubs. There are twenty-two trees in the park, offering a selection of   at least 9 different varieties, these are: spruce, birch, fir, mountain ash, mayday, maple, larch, green ash and crabapple.</p> 
<p>Those living nearby use the park for picnics and group meetings and it is a definite asset to the area and deserved to be named as it is.</p>
<p><b>Getting the Park named:</b> The story of getting the park named is worthy of mention. If the author had not actually experienced it he would not have believed it if he heard from anyone else. He originally thought that Wheeler Park would be a worthy name, Mrs. Vickie Wheeler, widow of Gordon, thought that Buttercup Park would be more appropriate so the process began. An application form was requested and received from the Secretary of the Park Naming Board: to be completed permission had to be obtained from the Community League. It took five months (May to October) to get this done. The response was an approval but with the joiner that no funds could be allotted.  The form was completed and submitted.</p>
<img src="park23.jpg" width=300 height=250 vspace=5 hspace=5 align=right alt="A view of the park">
<p>The form asked for a possible location for the sign, Vickie and the author agreed on the location, and also submitted suggestions for the type of plants.  There was no response from the city for several weeks. Enquiries found the secretary had been sick for an extended period of time; however, she was being held up because the community league had not answered her request to verify the permission already given. It turned out the community league president's computer had suffered a melt down and he was unaware of the request.</p> 
<p>Permission was given, the name approved, and it would be erected the next year. The author checked with the maintenance people who were to put up the sign and they were aware of it. OK, we have the name approved and the budget for the sign and the crew was aware of the sign needing to be put up.</p>
<p>It's late spring and the author sees a crew putting up the sign, he tells them that the location is wrong. The sign was to be placed in the 'pointy' south end of the park, not hidden in the 'tree-overhung border' at the north-end.  The placement of the sign meant it would be almost hidden from view and only offered a view to traffic southbound on 60 street.</p> 
<p>The supervisor of the crew indicated he would have to put the sign where he was putting it; several phone calls and a couple of days going by, resulted in the sign being removed and placed where originally requested. It was learned there was no communication between the Naming Committee and the people responsible for setting up the sign.</p> 
<p>The parks people had not notified nearby residents of the placing of the sign and they had received a concern from someone saying the sign was too high and blocked their view of the park. The height of the sign was reduced by a couple of feet or so. In the meantime the author had been asked to submit (again) a list of plants that would provide summer long bloom. With the help of a local nursery (Kuhlmanns) this was done. The plantings were done but bore no resemblance to the suggested plants. </p>
<p>Vickie and her family were told there could be a ceremony to officially name the park. Arrangements were made,but the city got their dates mixed-up. Yes, this is a true account! So help me!</p><br clear=all>

<p><b>The MAN</b></p>
<p>THE LONGEST-RUNNING RADIO PROGRAM IN THE WORLD<br>
By N. Breuer and J. Rollans (original source not known)</p>
<p>On Sunday, September 15, 1946, at 8.00 p.m. a voice was heard on CKUA making an announcement that would become a standard opening phrase: "Good evening ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Continental Musicale, an hour of European music and songs. I'm your host, Gaby Haas".</p>
<p>On Sunday, September 21, 1986, at 8.00 p.m. - for the 2081 st time - this same voice welcomed listeners to the same program. That marked the beginning of Gaby's 41 st year of broadcasting his program to Albertans, sharing with them a wide variety of recordings both old and new.</p>
<p>Gaby emigrated to Canada from Czechoslovakia in July 1939, and his radio career began that same year. For quite a while, he played in bands, often juggling gigs with radio shows. He recalls those early days with a smile: "We were playing on five radio stations at a time, making anywhere from $3 to $5 a show - a lot of money in those days. At that time, a full-course meal, including pie and coffee, was only 35 cents."</p>
<p>Gaby actually began his CKUA career in 1940, when the station was located on the U of A campus. He had about 50 records he had brought over from Europe. The music he plays is still his own, but the collection has expanded to include about 35,000 selections that he stores at home.</p>
<p>In 1945 Gaby played on "Alberta Ranch House", a program that was carried by the CBC Trans-Canada network from Vancouver to Montreal. He has fond memories of fellow performer Ameen (King) Ganam, who went on to start  "Country Hoedown" on CBC. After King Ganam went east, Gaby became leader of the band, changing its name to the "The Barn Dance Gang." (Former CKUA sportscaster Art Ward played trombone with this band from 1945 to 1946.)  Gaby recalls Harry Boone's contribution to the program with a mischievous smile. "He used to arrange our music. The man was very good, but the arrangements he wrote were tough. He knew that I couldn't read music very well = not enough to hurt my playing."</p>
<img src="park25.jpg" width=300 height=225 vspace=5 hspace=5 align=left alt="Gaby Haas Park">
<p>Gaby Haas is well known throughout Canada and the United States as Canada's "Mr. Polka". He has released 57 record albums and is looking forward to "50 years on Radio, 40 years on records, and 35 years on TV," All this will happen in 1989 and then, having achieved nice, round figures", I'll retire." With some of his albums being re-released, Gaby's music will be heard for many years to come.</p>
<p>The future? All the pertinent data on "Continental Musicale" has been forwarded to the editors of the "Guinness World Book of Records" in England. The New Zealand supplement to that publication lists a radio program in Wellington that was launched July 2, 1937, and ended on July 4, 1977 - but Gaby has topped that one. On that September Sunday in 1986, Gaby has established a new record: the longest-running radio program in the world - same air time, same day of broadcast, same host and producer.</p>
<p><center><b>ACTION</b><br>
(Perhaps a Q.C.F.M news release, undated.)</center></p> 
<p>To satisfy the cultural and linguistic desires of the ethnic people Q.C.F.M. has hired the services of Canada's Mr. Polka, Gaby Haas.</p>
<p>Mr. Haas is a Canadian recording artist with the distinction of having produced the largest number of records by any Canadian artist; to date he has recorded 51 albums. Besides being an accomplished musician, Gaby has a rare and comprehensive record collection containing over 100,00 "ethnic" records.</p>  
<p>For 15 years, he has produced a weekly radio program called Polka Party. This program can be heard on several Canadian radio stations. Before that time, he produced a program called Memories of Europe, where he played music from all the European countries.</p>
<p>For Q.C.F.M. Gaby produces The World Showcase of Music, a mixture of music from all corners of the world. On a weekly basis he receives newspapers and letters from most of the European countries, subscribes to European music magazines., as well as most Canadian music publications.</p>
<p>In addition to being an expert on music around the world, Gaby speaks eight languages fluently, and reads several more. Since starting his program Gaby has also generated interest from the Ethnic communities to produce their own programs. So far Gaby features a Pakistani Program, an Arabian Program. A German Features, A Scandinavian Show, and is presently negotiating a Chinese Show.</p>
<p>Daily, Gaby does on hour request show, taking calls from listeners and playing their favourite music from "home", occasionally inserting some good old Canadian recordings.</p><br clear=all><hr>

<p><b>THE PARK </b>The Park is quite large, stretching two blocks by a good three quarters the other side.  The area around the actual sign has been very nicely landscaped. The park includes a ball diamond and the children's area as shown in the photograph. The park is in use most of the summer and used by adults and children alike. It is an asset to the neighbourhood.</p>

<p><b>Highlands Park<br>
(11225 - 62 street- covers the area of 8 city lots- (.6 ha)- approved February 8, 1984)</b></p> 
<img src="park27.jpg" width=700 height=634 vspace=5 hspace=5 align=absmiddle alt="Highlands Park">
<p>Highlands Park: Initial investigation seems to indicate that the park was there and needed a name; it was in the Highlands so that was thought to be a suitable name! The secretary of the Park Naming Committee of the city could initially only tell me the park 'appeared' February 8, 1984! But more about that later.</p>
<p>Several people in the area have been asked if they know when the park was first on the scene. Clyde Martell remembers playing football on the park in the fifties; the author remembers the park being there when he moved into Highlands proper in 1963.</p>
<p>The secretary of the Parks Naming Committee was able to say that (remember the park is made up of 8 city lots):
<br>a.	Lots 1-2 Block 12 Plan 3642AJ became city property on February 28, 1923
<br>b.	Lot 4 Block 12 Plan 3642AJ became city property on March 23, 1923
<br>c.	Lot 5 Block 12 Plan 3642AJ became city property on September 25, 1929
<br>d.	Lot 3, Lots 6-8 Block 12 Plan 3642AJ became city property on June 14, 1947.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note the city assessment maps still shows the lot designations as noted above. So far we cannot tell how the city procured the lots. Metro Chrapko thought may be the lots had been donated: Perhaps it was in conjunction with the construction of the Community Hall in 1948, or the depression, or?</p>
<p>The City acquired the land for those lots between 1923 and 1947.  Three titled lots were acquired in the 1920's and one in 1947.  There are actually four separate titles over five lots but all were purchased by the City between the years indicated.  At least for the titled lots purchased in the 1920's, the price paid for the land was between $400 and $450.  They remain as separate lots because the City has not yet moved to consolidate the property.</p> 
<p>In trying to discover more information about the naming of the park the author casually mentioned it at a meeting of the Highland Place Seniors' Home committee. From a 'confidential but reliable source'... in 1984 there was a move to have the park named after an ethnic dance group... this encouraged (?) people to have the park called Highlands... and the mystery deepens!!</p>
<p>The 'great discovery' was shared with Cory Sousa, Planner, City of Edmonton, she provided the following... (Darrell Nordell, our own community coordinator has also been very much involved).</p>
<p>Hi John,<i> (informal because we 'chatted' back and forth... considerably!</i></p>
<p>I looked at the original minutes but there wasn't much detail. However, I do know that a particular dance group was looking at potential sites/parks to have named in their honour in and around the Highlands Neighbourhood in the past. While it's possible that this pushed the community to name their park 'Highlands', it wouldn't have been anything against any group, individual, or association. It's actually Parks Branch practice and stated in our Naming Policy to name the major park in a community after the Neighbourhood name. Therefore, one can assume that the community league pursued the naming of that park site to 'Highlands Parks' to have at least one park in their community reflecting their name and location, hence honouring the 'Highlands'heritage, regardless of who made an earlier application to name the park.</p>
<p>There is also some context that needs to be recognized during the early 1980's. The City of Edmonton went through a major Neighbourhood and Community boundary clean-up during this time. During annexation in 1982, there was a greater realization that many civic departments, community leagues, and agencies used different boundaries to identify communities. It was then directed by City Council to clean-up these issues and establish very defined boundaries for the neighbourhoods in which ALL Civic Departments, Community Leagues, and Agencies (ie. EdTel, Edmonton Power, etc.) would use.</p>
<p>This process eliminated smaller communities and their associated names. For example, what used to be known as two separate neighbourhoods 'Santa Rosa' and 'Montrose', were combined to form 'Montrose.'  Many long term residents of 'Santa Rosa' were upset about this, but as a compromise, the park that resided in their area was officially called 'Santa Rosa Park' to reinforce the previous history of the 'Santa Rosa' community/subdivision.</p>
<p>This process had to be done as there were many tiny subdivisions with their own unique names but the Administration needed consistency as Edmonton continued to grow.</p>
<p>Therefore, one can assume that the residents of 'Highlands' (going through this neighbourhood clean up process too, as all communities did in the early 80's) also didn't want to lose their identity and acted quickly to name a park after their neighbourhood. No offence to any ethic dance group, individual, etc. but it was something the community most likely would have done eventually.</p>
<p>I hope this all makes sense and helps solve the mystery to some degree.</p>
<p>The tree make-up is similar to that of the other parks with poplars and firs in the majority. The park has a modern set of children's playthings, a wading pool, and facilities for the summer programs that are sponsored   by the community and run by the city. </p><br clear=all>

<p>In a brief message before the memorial was unveiled by Miss Audrey Stutchbury, daughter of the late Mr. Stutchbury, Hon. J. Percy Page, Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta, called Mr. Stutchbury, a "servant of the public and a gentlemen in the true sense of the word".</p>
<p>Mayor Roper said Mr. Stutchbury did as much as anyone in Alberta to promote culture in the province. He added that city council was glad to provide land named Stutchbury Park, the three acre park in which the memorial is located.</p>
<img src="park34.jpg" width=250 height=172 vspace=5 hspace=5 align=left alt="A view of the park">
<p>Welfare Minister R.D. Jorgenson called Mr. Stutchbury a man "who believed in Christian principles, and in the dignity of man", and "felt impelled to give of himself in the interest of other people."</p>
<p>	The final speaker, Brig. J.C. Jefferson, chairman on the Alberta Safety Council, said that Mr. Stutchbury was an "inspiring leader: nothing was to much trouble or too difficult from him. He lived the philosophy of being his brother's keeper."</p>
<p>	Rev. Ray Leppard of Moore Memorial United Church in Redwater delivered the invocation. James Falconer, chairman of the city's landmark and archives committee, introduced the speakers. Also attending the ceremony were Garnet Kyle, city archivist, Major Elmyr Stutchbury and Ewert Stutchbury, sons of Howard Stutchbury.</p>

<p>Now be honest, you have never even noticed the sign, even though it's clearly visible as you drive east on 112 Avenue and as you near 76 Street. Here is the story of the sign. (What's on the sign appears below).</p>
<p>Taken from "Real Estate Weekly", November 5, 1998, author, the late Alex Mair, provided by the City of Edmonton Archives.</p>
<p><center><b>THE YEAR THE MOUNTIES CAME TO TOWN</b></center></p>
<p>It's your Heritage</p>
<p>It was 124 years ago the last week that the first detachment of the North West Mounted Police arrived in Edmonton, and that was quite a turning point in our history.</p>
<p>It wasn't a big group. There were 20 men under the command of Inspector Jarvis, and they arrived here on October 27, 1874. It was all part of the creation of the police force that was to bring law and order to the west, and the Edmonton post was at the northwest end of the string of establishments that stretched from Fort Ellice to Fort Edmonton. The original intent was to base the detachment at the Hudson's Bay fort, but it seems that part of the mandate of the commanding officer was the responsibility for choosing where he wanted to build the base for his unit. And that's where the fun started here in Edmonton.</p> 
<p>Jarvis' men spent the winter months of 1874-75 at the Hudson's Bay fort here, but the spent part of their time learning a bit about the country as well as the problems they were to face. At the same time, Jarvis was looking around for a spot to erect his base of operations. Why not right here in Edmonton at the existing fort? We may never know the full answer to that question, but there is a strong suggestion that there was a conflict of opinion taking place that winter, and the participants were both men of strong opinions. On the one hand, we had Richard Hardisty as the Chief Factor at Fort Edmonton. He felt that the North West Mounted Police should be based here at Fort Edmonton, but on the south side of the river about where the University campus sits today.</p>
<p>That was one man and his opinion. The other man was Inspector Jarvis, and in his opinion, nobody was going to tell him where to establish his operations. His choice, and it certainly showed Hardisty who was the boss as far as the NWMP were concerned, was at Fort Saskatchewan. In the showdown, Inspector Jarvis won, and it was a long time before things changed very much. It wasn't until 1915 that the North West Mounted Police moved their base from Fort Saskatchewan and established it back here in Edmonton.</p> 
<p>As one drives east on 112 Avenue and nears 76 street a relatively small sign will (perhaps) catch your attention in Stutchbury Park. The sign is not particularly big, nor does it really have anything that draws your attention to it. The author had passed the sign, forever as it were, and not paid the slightest attention to it. However, when preparing information on Stutchbury Park, he decided to check it out. He is glad he did as it reveals an interesting tidbit on local history.</p>
<p><b>The sign reads:</b></p>
<p><center>The arrival of the North West Mounted Police
<br>At a point near here, at five o'clock in the morning of October 27 in 1874
<br>The first contingent of North West Mounted Police en route to Fort Edmonton,
<br>set up their camp. 
<br>Sub-Inspector S. Gagnon with two ox teams and Sgt. Major S.B. Steele with
<br>a small company of exhausted men and horses rested here for three short 
<br>hours.
<br>They were joined by Inspector W.D. Jarvis, The Officer in Charge, who
<br>had pressed on ahead, and who brought from Fort Edmonton, 
four arduous miles away, the welcome news that good winter quarters awaited them.</center></p>
<p><center>Two Officers and twenty NCOs and Men temporarily established the Headquarters 
of A Division N.W.M.P. at Edmonton and permanently established the 
traditions of Courage and Integrity which live on in the RCMP today.</center></p>
