<p><b>ST. MARY'S ANGLICAN CHURCH</b></p>
<p>The History of St. Mary's Anglican, The Highlands 1913-1994</p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">St. Mary's Anglican Church, commenced as a Sunday school for the children of Anglican families in the Highlands area of Edmonton.  In February of 1913, an Anglican deaconess, out from England, began her missionary work in a log house situated on 74 street and Jasper Avenue.  Sadly, this building was struck by lightning and burned to the ground August of that year. The furnishings from this early building were, however, saved and the congregation moved to a frame building in the same area, the area of the Standard Coal Mine in the Virginia Park area.</p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify"> Mrs. Lloyd, Superintendent of the Sunday school at that time, brought her children to her own home for the Sunday school classes.  This house, still in good repair, stands at 11209-66 street (then called Wentworth Street).  It is noteworthy by the curved arches on its second floor balcony.
</p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">The Rev. Norman Ashby was St. Mary's first Priest-in-Charge.  He came from England as did all St. Mary's early rectors.  In the early years, all Anglican parishes were subsidized by the Mother Church of England and all early Anglican clergymen in Canada came from the Motherland.  The Rev. Ashby was with St. Mary's from its inception July, 1913 until October, 1914.</p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">Through the generosity of a Rev. Mr. Sale, three thirty-three foot lots were purchased at the present site of St. Mary's.  Construction began June, 1914, of a 20' by 30' building.  Upon completion, this church was dedicated to the Glory of God by Bishop Harry Allan Grey, the first Bishop of the newly-formed Diocese of Edmonton. Early records and pictures show that the Sunday school flourished greatly from that time on.</p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">Between the years, 1918-20, St. Mary's shared its minister with St. Michael's Anglican Church in North Edmonton.  He was the Reverend F. D. Mercer who had been Chaplain of the Church of England to the Embassy in Japan prior to coming to Canada.</p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify"> 1922-26 saw the Rev. Mr. Swann at St. Mary's.  During his incumbency many changes were made in the church building itself.  It was raised to allow a brick-walled basement to be built beneath it.  The chancel and sanctuary were added.  During part of this time, parishioners received notice that "No further services in the church building were possible due to the intense cold in the building because of the church extension".</p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">During these early years and, too, into the 1940's, Judge Bury acted in many capacities in St. Mary's:  church warden, lay reader, organist, vestryman and preacher.  While organist, Judge Bury is quoted as saying: "It is doubtful the heater was ever lighted; even at morning service, the frost covered keys of the organ 'Burned' the organist's fingers." Electric lighting was installed and the west end of the church building was extended, allowing 105 seats.</p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text align:justify">The Rev. H.H. Stickings served as St. Mary's rector from 1926-28.  The Rev. Leversedge followed.  Later Mr. Leversedge was named 'Cannon' and later still 'Archdeacon'.</p>
<p style="text-indent:50px;text align justify">From 1938-40 the Rev. Mr. Story was St. Mary's rector, until he left for active service in World War II.  Much was accomplished during his short stay at St. Mary's.  The bell tower was added, church windows were installed and the choir stalls were added. During those early years in Edmonton, present day 112 avenue was called Knox Avenue, 68 st was know as Wadleigh Street.</p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">In 1943 a promising and influential Men's Club was formed at St. Mary's under the impressive leadership of the late Leonard Suss.  This Men's club undertook the superintendency of the Sunday school and one of its members, Wilbur Scott, held that position for many years.  The men's Club took under their wing parish service men, home following the war, until each one was once again established into civilian life.</p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">The Men's Club landscaped and cared for the church grounds, after which many old timers still recall the delightful garden parties held during the summer months.  The Men's Club was influential in replacing the individual chairs in the church nave with conventional pews.  These they acquired from the masons who had purchased a former church for their lodge. St. Mary's and St. Mark's parishes shared the Rev. Arthur Elliott as their rector until 1946.</p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align justify">June, 1944, saw St. Mary's first ordination when Jack L. Anderson was ordained to the diaconate.  Noteworthy too, is the fact that Jack was the first Edmontonian to take Holy Orders in the Anglican Church. Through these years, the Church Building sat on the site of the present Chapel.
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">In 1946, the Reverend W.W. (Bill) Elkin became rector of St. Mary's and would remain thus until 1958, the longest incumbency to that date.  Many, many changes took place during Bill's tenure.  The church was moved from its original site to its present location, now known as the "upper hall".  The so-called Sunday school building was constructed on the former church site.  This building now houses the chapel and the nursery.</p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">In 1949, the rectory was built for Bill, Kay and their family.  Prior to that the Elkins made their home in a house in the 111 block of 62 st.  (little house next to the alley on the east side of 62<sup>nd</sup> st.  Vestry notes that for the house, a rent of $60. per month was paid.
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align: justify">Plans were drawn up by Ken Alton for the building plans and construction of the present St. Mary's Church. A proud day it was indeed when the entire congregation met outdoors following the morning service the May of 1953, to watch Bishop Barfoot turn the first sod from which would rise the new St. Mary's.  The two wardens, attendant at the sod-turning ceremony that day still (since passed away) remain parishioners of St. Mary's: Bob White and Eric Marsh. What a happy day it was for the family of St. Mary's when on January 23, 1954, Bishop-elect Clarke, Dean of Ottawa, dedicated the new St. Mary's Church to the glory of God.  Dean Clarke became Bishop of Edmonton Diocese the following Day.</p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">During the early years, St. Mary's Junior Auxiliary (the J.A.) flourished as many young girls in its ranks took many awards on the Diocesan level, revealing the very fine training by their dedicated leaders. The 40<sup>th</sup> Edmonton Scout Troop, met at St. Mary's weekly under the able direction of Scout master Lawrence Twigge, and others.  During those years, ten Boy Scouts from the 40<sup>th</sup> became Queen Scouts.
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">When the Rev. Bill Elkin left St. Mary's, Archdeacon G.W. Wilson became St. Mary's rector. And so, through the following years, under the leadership of Canon Brian Brown (1964-1973),  the Rev. Fabian W. Hugh (1973-1979), Dr. Ed Schmitt (1979-1982, the Rev. Alex Thomas (1982-1987), St Mary's then enjoyed having as its priest-in-charge Canon George E. Morris until his death.</p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">It was during the time of Rev. George Morris that Wayne Masliuk was ordained Vocational Deacon by Bishop Victoria Matthews.  After Father George's retirement, the parish was served by an Interim ministry team (Wendy Ainsworth - later ordained and Rev. Donald Grey).  Rev. Thomas Brauer was rector from 2007 to 2009 when Rev. Elizabeth Metcalfe was appointed Interim Priest.  She was appointed Rector effective Sept. 1, 2009. Thus, St. Mary's Anglican Church, the Highlands, has developed for nearly 100 years as a vibrant church on the move, producing regular outreach to those beyond its doors, as well as administering to its own congregation's spiritual and social needs.</p>
