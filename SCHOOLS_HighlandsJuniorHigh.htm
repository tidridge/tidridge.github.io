			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The Highlands School reflects the sporadic growth of the Highlands district from its beginnings as a rural fringe of the City of Edmonton to its present stature as one of the city&#39;s respectable &amp; beautiful residential districts.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><font color="blue" size="2">Highlands School, the Original Building c 1912 Photograph supplied by EPSB Archives, from the Benbow Archives.</font></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">In its almost fifty years, the school has grown from a one-room ungraded school to a twenty-three room elementary and junior high school, increasing in size periodically to meet the needs of the expanding community.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><b>Early History</b></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Accurate information concerning the Highlands School before 1912 is difficult to obtain. For several years prior to that time it was a one-room school, administered by an independent rural school district which included the present districts of Highlands and North Edmonton and the present town of Beverley.<font color="blue"><sup>1,2</sup></font>. Certainly for the greater part of the school year of 1911-12 it was still such a school, with one Miss Ida Murch as teacher.<font color="blue"><sup>3</sup></font></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The real estate boom of that time had already begun to affect the district, however, so that by March of 1912 the enrolment had reached sixty-six pupils. In fact, it had become necessary to add a second classroom to the building, and in April of 1912 the pupils were divided into two classes under two new teachers -- Mr. Harry E. Ba1four, principal, and Miss Nellie Scarth. <font color="blue"><sup>4,5</sup></font></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The registers of 1912 and 1913 include the names of children of some of the district&#39;s oldest families. Such names Marian Gimby and Adrian McGrath are examples.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The district&#39;s continued growth soon made further classes accommodation necessary. By autumn of 1913 there were five classrooms in operation: the following year there were six.<sup>6</sup> These four new rooms were located in two new temporary frame buildings on the west side of 62 Street. The original building was on the present school site on the east side of the street.<font color="blue"><sup>7</sup></font></span></p>

			<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><b>The New Building</b></span></p>
			<span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><img align="right" alt="Highlands Junior High School" height="204" hspace="5" src="hihjh01.jpg" vspace="5" width="300" /></span>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">By this time it was apparent that a more permanent school building would be necessary. Also at this time the Highlands School became a part of the Edmonton Public School system. While it is certain that the new brick building was begun in August, 1913,<font color="blue"><sup>8</sup></font> it is not certain in what year the Edmonton School Board took over the school.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><font color="blue" size="2">The photograph taken c 1922-23 shows Highlands Junior High School (brick), the Temporary Highlands School next to the brick structure, and Highlands Cottage School across from the brick structure. The photo, donated by Mrs. Dorothy Husband, shows, on the left, Gladys Griffith, and Julia May Griffith. Material provided by the Archives of the epsb. </font></span></p>
			<span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Mr. Balfour believes that it was in the autumn of 1913, and certainly it would seem reasonable to suppose that the Board would not begin work on a new school in an area not yet under its administration.<font color="blue"><sup>9</sup></font> However, the Board minutes indicate that the Highlands School became part of the city system in September of 1914. Mr. Balfour remained as principal until November of 1914, when he was appointed principal of Park Dale School. His successor at Highlands was Mr. S. J. Davies <font color="blue"><sup>10</sup>.</font></span>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The first floor of the present school was completed by February of 1916. Consisting of seven classrooms, principal&#39;s office, and a small auditorium-gymnasium, it cost approximately 125,000<font color="blue"><sup>11</sup></font> a princely sum for that period. The contracting firm was Read, McDonald and Brewster<font color="blue"><sup>12</sup></font>.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The seventh room was indeed welcome, for until the new building opened, Miss Elizabeth Cuming had been struggling with sixty-six grade one pupils in one room in the old building. With the new seventh room available, Miss M.B. Clifton took charge of about half of Miss Cuming&#39;s pupils <font color="blue"><sup>13</sup></font> available, Miss. M. B. Clifton took charge of about half of Miss Cuming&#39;s pupils.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The enrolment [sic] of the School remained fairly static at about 250 until the year l920-21.<font color="blue"><sup>14</sup></font> In May of 1919, work on the second storey of the school was begun by the firm of Amundson and Morrison. By April 1920 five new classrooms were ready for occupancy.<font color="blue"><sup>15</sup></font></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Many changes took pace in the Highlands School in 1920. In the fall of that year Mr. Wilbur J. Kelly became principal; he was to remain at the school in that capacity for twenty-five years.<font color="blue"><sup>16</sup></font> At the same time, the school was expanded to occupy twelve rooms and to provide instruction in all grades from kindergarten to grade ten.<font color="blue"><sup>17</sup></font> How long the school continued to offer instruction in kindergarten and grade ten is uncertain. It seems likely, from an examination of the registers, that grade ten was taught until l928 or l929<font color="blue"><sup>18</sup></font>. The kindergarten was probably more short-lived. The years 1922 and 1923 seem to have been &#39;lean&#39; ones insofar as school construction and extras services are concerned, and it does not seem improbable that the kindergarten may have been discontinued in one of these years.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><u>Edmonton Normal School</u></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">It was in 1920 that the Highlands School became the home of the Edmonton Normal School.</span></p>

			<blockquote><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">&quot;January 1920, A Normal School was opened at Edmonton in the Highlands School, and a class of 110 students was enrolled. These students... after the completion their course of twelve weeks were granted Third Class Certificates in order that they would be available for rural schools in May.&quot; <font color="blue"><sup>19</sup></font></span></blockquote>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Following the short course the Normal School continued offering regular winter sessions.</span></p>

			<blockquote><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">&quot;Negotiations with the Board if School Trustees of the City of Edmonton resulted in quarters being secured at Highlands School sufficient to house Normal classes for the academic year 1920-1912&quot;</span></blockquote>

			<blockquote><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">&quot;one hundred and sixteen students enrolled for the first regular session of this school&quot;</span></blockquote>

			<blockquote><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">&quot;In September a Junior High School was established in the Highlands and as a consequence the Normal School has had the advantage of full practice Facilities from the kindergarten to grade X <font color="blue"><sup>20</sup></font>.&quot;</span></blockquote>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The Normal School continued to operate at Highlands for three years.... Until the summer of 1923... for the greater part under the direction of Mr. C. Sansom. However, the accommodations became too limited for the increased enrollment</span></p>

			<blockquote><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">&quot;In the fall term (1922) 297 students enrolled and the problem of accommodating this number in the limited space available in the Highlands School was a serious one&quot;<font color="blue"><sup>21</sup></font>.</span></blockquote>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Finally, in the summer of 1923, the Normal School was discontinued. In summarizing its activities, Mr. G. Fred McNally, Supervisor of Schools, wrote:</span></p>

			<blockquote><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">&quot;The Edmonton Normal School was organized in 1920 to provide a short course for a group of students to relieve the acute shortage of teachers at that time. Three regular classes received their training here during the succeeding three years. In all, nearly one thousand students were enrolled here during its short life&quot;<font color="blue"><sup>22</sup></font></span></blockquote>

			<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><u>1923 - 1947</u></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Following the discontinuation of the Normal School, the Highlands School continued for another two years with little change in its enrolment [sic] and organization. However, work was continuing on the second storey. By June of 1926 there were fifteen rooms in operation, with a total enrolment {sic}of 576. In 1930 all seventeen rooms were occupied, with 678 pupils<font color="blue">23</font>.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">From that time until 1947 the school remained relatively unchanged. One extra room was added, in the boys&#39; basement, providing eighteen rooms. These eighteen rooms provided accommodation for two classes of each grade from one to nine. It was to remain this way until after World war II<font color="blue"><sup>24</sup></font></span></p>

			<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><u>The Postwar Period.</u></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Following world War II the Highlands district experienced another period of rapid growth. Until that time the school had been more or less on the fringe of the district. Surrounding were large vacant areas, as indeed there were throughout the Highlands district. The years immediately following the war saw most of these vacant lots occupied. The increased population necessitated the building of a number of elementary schools, viz. Bellevue, Virginia Park, Montrose, and Mount Royal. It also necessitated a great change in the organization of the Highlands School, so that the many students who finished grade six at the new elementary schools might have junior high school accommodation. The change toward a predominantly junior high school began in 1948, and by 1949-50 there were ten rooms of grades seven, eight and nine. This year and the following one were years of extreme crowding. Some elementary grades were taught in double shifts. Extra temporary classrooms were set up in such places as the girls&#39; playroom, the auditorium, and so on. The enrolment reached as high as 780.<font color="blue"><sup>25</sup></font></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">From that year on, the number of junior high school rooms steadily increased, by one or two rooms per year. The elementary classes thus displaced were accommodated either in temporary rooms at the Highlands or in the new classrooms as they were available at the new elementary schools.<font color="blue"><sup>26</sup></font></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Finally in the spring of 1954, work was begun on an addition to the school - six new classrooms and a gymnasium. The contractor for the work was R. H. Rae. The work progressed rather slowly and it was not until January of 1956 that the grade nine classes could begin to move into their new accommodations. The year of 1955-56 was therefore another year of overcrowding. That year there were twenty-two classes in an eighteen room school. Such a feat was accomplished by housing classes in the girls&#39; basement, the gymnasium, and in whatever classroom was temporarily vacant (i.e. a &#39;floater&#39;). Finally the new building was ready for occupancy, and conditions eased considerably.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">At the present time, the Highlands School consists of twenty junior high rooms, and three elementary rooms. This leaves, apparently, one room vacant. That is the room in the boys&#39; playroom, built in the early &#39;thirties, which served the school in such a thoroughly unsatisfactory manner for so many years. The school serves the junior high school needs of about 660 boys and girls from Borden Park east to the city limits and from l27<sup>th</sup> Avenue south to the river.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><u>The Student Body</u></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">From its beginning the Highland School has included students of a variety of national origins. The registers of 1912 contain many Slavic names as well as many Anglo-Saxon ones. When the Highlands district expanded in 1912-&#39;14, there was an influx of people of British stock, but this was more or less balanced by an increase in the number of people of eastern European origin north of ll8<sup>th</sup> Avenue and also considerably east of the school, toward Beverly. Until the present time, this mixture has existed. In the registers one finds almost as many Huculaks and Skulkis as Cunninghams and Hillers</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The school has also since its beginning included students of all socio-economic classes. The school serves a large area which includes wealthy residential areas as well as working class and industrial areas.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><u>The Teaching Staff.</u></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">In its more than forty years, the Highlands School has included on its staff many teachers who have become well known in the city, either as teachers or in some other capacity. Mr. Harry E. Balfour, the first principal, has occupied a number of positions with the Department of Education and is now the Director of School Administration for the Department. Miss Adele Philp, who was on the staff from 1917 until 1922 is now the wife of Alderman Fred Mitchell. Others include Miss L. F. Munro, Mr. Ken Smith, Mr. George M</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">DINNER</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><b>Pat Dawson</b></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Not everyone on the organizing committee knew Pat Dawson, but when his name was suggested as a guest speaker, we all agreed that we wanted to hear his &quot;take&quot; on Highlands School. Other than being an educator, basketball official and all round good guy, Pat was the instigator of the last Highlands Reunion - in 1989 at the 75 year mark. Pat was the first person to do what has been called &quot;a Pat Dawson triple.&quot; This accomplishment is to be a teacher, an assistant principal, and the principal at Highlands School. I can&#39;t tell you how proud I was 2010 when I could phone Pat to let him know that I was the second person to do a Pat Dawson triple. Ladies and Gentlemen, my friend and mentor, Pat Dawson.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">And thank you Pat Dawson - not just for that speech that gave us insight into the Mr. Botsford Years, but for all that you have done for Edmonton Public School students, staff and community members. We see here tonight many of the staff members that he worked with in his final run at Highlands School from 1986 - 1992. I was privileged to be there for four of those years. By my count, from the staff that Pat had at Highlands in those six years, at least a dozen went on to positions of senior leadership in the school district. Everywhere that Pat went, he positively impacted people &ndash; whether it was in the church, on the basketball floor, at the Special Ed. Socials or Friday afternoons at the Firefighter&rsquo;s Social Club.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Just as we chose Pat to share his memories of Highlands School, I have been allowed to have some time to share. I have gathered information from a number of sources. History &ndash; special thanks to John Tidridge, Lawrence Herzog and Don Hepburn, the one thing that is constant at Highlands is change.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">In the early 1900&#39;s the Highlands area was not part of the city of Edmonton. River lots 32 and 34 were divided up and sold by developers. They convinced the city to run the streetcar out to the Highlands area.(60 &ndash; 61 St.) There wasn&#39;t really much of a school for students at that time. Highlands School District was taken into the Edmonton School District in 1912 with the promise that a new school would be built. Before the brick building that we know as Highlands today, there were actually three different temporary schools. One to the north of the present school, and the other two were on the opposite side of 62 Street. Each of the first three schools were &quot;re-purposed&quot;. In 1933, School # 1 (the cottage school) was moved by steam tractor to 118 Avenue and 50 street where it became Odynski&#39;s general store. School # 2 was moved to the site of Cromdale School in 1924, and #3 was turned into a private residence.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The Highlands School that we know now was described by Lawrence Herzog as: &quot;Collegiate gothic style, with crenellated parapets, a commanding central tower, oriel window over the main entry and Tudor arches over many of the windows and doors. The structure is of steel and concrete clad with brick and stone.&quot;</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">It took several years for the school to be built on Block 14, lots 1 &ndash; 14 of the Highlands area. &ndash; classes started on the first floor at Easter in 1916, and it wasn&#39;t until about 1920 that five of the rooms on the top floor were completed. At this time, electricity was brought into the building. As well, from 1920 &ndash; 1923, Highlands also hosted a &quot;Normal School&quot;.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">I want you to take a moment, and think about how the school looked and was organized and operated a hundred years ago. Think of the changes! You have some idea from the Highlands School Highlights on your tables. Special thanks to Doreen and the committee members that put all that together.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">I want to fill in some more of the blanks and walk you through the changes seen by Highlands School over the past 100 years (or so)</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">To begin. The school wasn&#39;t on 62 Street. Highlands School was on Grace Street, just south of Alberta Avenue, north of Bailey Avenue. Students would get to the school by walking on the dirt roads &ndash; that were mostly mud in the spring and fall, and then have to use the boot scraper. Then students would walk up the steps &ndash; there were no elevators or ramps) - to go in their separate Boys and Girls entrances. When the students got into the school (no hobnails or clickers allowed!) they would go to their classrooms and hang their coats on hooks in the cloakroom. There were no lockers.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Students would sit in their desks that were bolted to the floor in rows. Inside the flip top of the desk would be the writing utensils. There was a hole in the top of the desk for your ink bottle. You dipped your straight pen into the ink to practice your cursive writing. The school was very comfortable with the steady (if somewhat smelly) heat of the coal fired boilers. When electricity was finally put in, there were electric lights! On the wall was a large piece of slate. This was the true &quot;blackboard.&quot; Green boards came later, followed by white boards. Teachers always seem to have something to write on.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Until the city could connect the water and sewer to the school in 1920, &quot;Outbuildings&quot; were the only source of relief.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">There were books in the school, but not many. There were far more students, and sharing books was the way things were done a hundred years ago. At this time, many students left their formal schooling by age 14 &ndash; this was the era of the JUNIOR high school. If you could get as far as grade nine or ten, you could consider yourself educated. I am not sure if there is any cause and effect here, but by 14, most boys are getting to be man-sized and want to be treated like a man. Discipline in the schools was enforced by The Strap. Perhaps many left school because they didn&rsquo;t like being hit. We do a far better job in our schools now, and don&rsquo;t hit kids.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">And Now &ndash; to the changes! And my how things have changed.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">1940 &ndash; request from Highlands Community League that one block in front of the school be graveled. The city replied that there was no money (Canada was at war then)<br />
			1947 &ndash; natural gas was put in to replace the coal fired boilers.<br />
			In 1949 &ndash; 50, there were 812 pupils. A ten foot fence 48 feet long was erected on the south boundary of the school grounds to protect the windows of the Highlands Community League . This was because &ldquo;17 panes of glass were broken during football games in the fall of 1949 &ldquo;. The principal of the school was required to pay the total cost of the glass - $12.75 I figure that some of you here tonight were part of those football shenanigans and should be paying the school back for your destruction. With inflation, interest &ndash; about $10,000 &hellip;.. For a while, the elementary students were &ldquo;double shifting&rdquo; due to a lack of room. Following World War II and the resulting Baby Boom, the population of Highlands swelled.. To meet the needs of the area, the school district built elementary schools in Bellevue, Montrose, Virginia Park and Mount Royal.<br />
			1951 &ndash; asphalt paving of the street.<br />
			1952 - 61 street from 114 Avenue to 118 Avenue was closed.<br />
			1954 &ndash; School board purchased the area to the east of the school - Block 15, lots #1 &ndash; 10 and 61 Street so that construction on the new wing could continue.<br />
			In 1955, the Annex opened with Industrial Arts and Home Economics labs. The &ldquo;New Wing&rdquo; opened in 1956. Before it opened, there were 22 classes, sharing 18 rooms.<br />
			In the 1960&#39;s , things changed again. Students were not as willing to do things the way they always had been done. The students&rsquo; hair got longer, and neither boys or girls continued to dress like their parents. Songs like Bob Dylan&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Times They Are A-Changin&rsquo;&rsquo; Students quit using the boys and girls entrances, they had desks that could move around the room, they used ballpoint pens, the teachers used the new &ldquo;greenboards&rdquo;<br />
			In the 1970&#39;s there was much more in the way of travel, field trips, and exchanges.<br />
			By the 1980&#39;s travel was just &ldquo;expected&rdquo; and students travelled both inside and outside of Canada with their teachers. And Why not have your own school bus? former students came back as teachers &ndash; Ann, Bev &hellip; Edmonton Public Schools decentralized the budgeting process to allow schools to have more control over their own finances, and opened the boundaries to allow students to attend the school of choice. Computers! &ndash; the first Apple computers were installed upstairs in the computer room.<br />
			1986 &ndash; There really are ghosts at Highlands. We all have heard of &ldquo;Harold in the Tower&rdquo; In the summer, there was the filming of the horror movie, &ldquo;Hello Mary Lou, Prom Night 2&rdquo;<br />
			1989 &ndash; Homecoming &#39;89 to celebrate the 75 <sup>th</sup> birthday of Highlands.<br />
			1990&#39;s &ndash; Highlands was still a happening place. Activities galore for the students and staff. But neighborhood demographics &ndash; fewer and fewer families with school age children meant enrolments started to drop.<br />
			2000&#39;s &ndash; Highlands became a district site for the Pre-Advanced Placement program. Computers became just part of the Interactive White Boards that could get students anywhere in the world at the touch of a button. Students broadened their horizons with an exchange with the Quebec City High School.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The school was &quot;wired for wireless&quot; connectivity, and many students now bring their own devices &ndash; smart phones, tablets and laptops.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Highlands School . It has gone by several different names - Highlands School. Highlands Elementary and Junior High School. Highlands Public School. Highlands Elementary and Intermediate School. Highlands Junior High School. Regardless of the name over the door -</span></p>
			<span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><img align="right" alt="Brad.

Highlands School has a strong history of academic, athletic and community achievements. In 2014, the Highlands School Building is not only celebrating its 100 <sup>th</sup> year, but the school is adding to its offerings by becoming an Arts Core school. I now ask Principal Brad Burns to join us and tell us about the current school and its direction for the next 100 years.</span>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Thank you Brad. Every time I talk with this man, or hear him speak, I am more impressed.

Dawson&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p style=" height="328" hspace="15" src="hihjh06.jpg" vspace="5" width="300" />Thank you to the committee for organizing this event and a special thank you to Ken Lelacheur and Grace for keeping me informed about arrangements. Thank you, also, for the honour of being able to share with you a small bit of what makes Highlands School a special place for many of us.</span>

			<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">&nbsp;</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">My presentation is primarily a tribute to a gentleman that created the foundation for making Highlands School a lasting legacy in north-east Edmonton during the 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">He was an imposing figure. About 6&#39; 1&quot;, straight in stature, steel blue eyes and always wearing his neatly pressed blue-gray suit. Always the white shirt, tie and buttoned suit jacket. In his younger days he was an outstanding athlete and a tennis champion in Alberta. In his military career during WW II he was a high ranking officer responsible for all flights west of London for the bombing raids on Nazi held territory.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">He was always Mr. Botsford. On the golf course, where he excelled, none of us would call him, Gordon. When I was appointed Assistant Principal at Highlands in 1968, even after he said to me, &quot;For God&#39;s sake man, I am Gordon, not mister!&quot; it was still difficult to call him Gordon. Everything was formal but very much to the point. As staff members we shared the common introduction to Highlands School, Botsford style. &quot;Here is your room key. You will be in Room 5.&quot; That was it. That was your orientation to teaching at Highlands. BUT, Gordon was a leader. Gordon influenced every student, teacher and parent with a concern and belief in learning, a rapport he established through interest in every person he touched and actions that validated those beliefs and relationships. His mode of operation and delegation allowed staff, students and parents to bring their talents, their beliefs and their actions to the table and as a result a proud community school evolved. We all felt proud to be part of Highlands School. Over the years there was something mystical, magical and spiritual that took place when you entered Highlands School and became part of that school community.</span></p>
			<span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><img align="right" alt="Mr. Botsford" height="310" hspace="15" src="hihjh09.jpg" vspace="5" width="200" /></span>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">My own Highlands journey started in 1963. Having graduated in Pharmacy and with two years as a retail Pharmacist behind me there was just not the enjoyment, reward and satisfaction forthcoming that should be experienced in a career. Fortunately, my wife, Liz, supported my return to University. I did work as a relief Pharmacist while back at University to help the family budget. By sheer coincidence on that summer day in 1963, I was relieving at a drug store on a Sunday afternoon when the clerk in the store said her brother was coming to pick her up to take her to a family gathering. Her chauffer was none other than Gordon Botsford. When I told him I was enrolled in Education at the U of A and would be graduating after summer school, he stated that there was a teaching position waiting for me at Highlands School. The Edmonton Public personnel people had firmly told me there would be no way I would just walk into a position. About two days later I was called by personnel to report to Highlands School the next day.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 400px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><font color="blue" size="2">Mr. Gordon Botsford</font></span></p>
			<span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">I had been introduced to the Botsford influence!!!</span>

			<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">&nbsp;</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Gordon Botsford lived in the Highlands area, the parents knew him and the students knew him. He supported the community and we were introduced to family names like McPhail, Martell, Haas, Wheeler, Heard, Agnew, Audley, Paris, MacSporran, Milne, Cheriton, King, Gafuik, Kuhnke and many, many, many others. All of those many names appeared in later years as professionals, politicians, community builders, athletes, artists, musicians and activists for a better society. There was a bonding between Gordon Botsford, the community and the school. We were encouraged to know &quot;our&quot; families.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Just changing gears, from an administrative point of view, you might remember a few things from those days:</span></p>

			<ul>
				<li><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">There were separate boys and girls entrances and separate gathering rooms, girls&#39; basement and the boys&#39; basement.</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The front door was for visitors only.</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Everyone wanted to know about the ghost in the bell tower.</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The lunch hours were very long as Gordon felt all students should go home for lunch.</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">You marched from class to class in double file.</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">There were up and down staircases.</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">There were no lockers in the old building until 1968 when Gordon relented and they were installed. Gordon thought it was better for the teachers to travel to the students in grade seven and eight rather than have the &ldquo;little rascals&rdquo;, as he called them, running all over the place.</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">There were separate staff rooms for men and women.</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Smoking was allowed in the staff rooms.</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">In the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s the student population hovered around the 700 to 750 mark.</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">There were three primary classrooms but these were relocated in the mid-60&#39;s.</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">There were a couple of &quot;traveling&quot; classes that did not have homerooms due to overcrowding. Those classes went wherever a particular class was having shop or Phys. Ed.</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The larger library was not established until 1963 and then later enlarged to take up two classrooms.</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Because Gordon was so competitive, the whole school shut down each spring for a couple days so the Track and Field Teams could practice. &quot;This year, lookout Eastwood!&quot;</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Staff meetings were on Friday and never went more than one hour. Gordon expected to be on the first tee no later than 4 PM with the male staff members.</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">There were names of staff members like Nick Tkachuk, affectionately known as the Prussian School Master, Mary Chandler, known as the teller of tall tales, Margaret Dean known as second in command in the office, and others like Ada Wynn, Ernie Wynnychuk, Bill Mukanik, Sonja Allore, Grace Chichak, Carl Carlson and Anne Coultman.</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">It was interesting that a high percentage of the teachers, after experiencing the Botsford School of Administration, went on to leadership roles in the district or in other districts.</span></li>
			</ul>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">There are some Botsford characteristics that many of you from that era might remember.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">1. Gordon had a nervous shrug in his shoulders when a staff meeting went too long or you were boring him or you knew he had heard enough or just leave and get on your way or he was just somewhere where he did not want to be.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">2. Gordon was known as the Gray Ghost. He was the subject of a poem, The Gray Ghost, written by a student for the school paper. The poem did a superb job of describing Gordon and the last line stated, &quot;You do not see him but you know he is there.&quot;</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">While Gordon assembled a great staff each year, we were fortunate in the late 80&#39;s and early 90&#39;s to assemble a staff that was just as talented, committed and effective so it is also my honour to say we had the best teaching staff, the best assistant principal, the best office staff, the best district administrators, including George Traynor and Mike Strembitsky who are here this evening, and the best school system anyone could ask for during my last six years of teaching.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">To the students, staff and parents who worked with us for my 12 years at Highlands School I say thank you. You did give me the reward, satisfaction and enjoyment that I was looking for in my working life. Last April Liz gave the keynote address at a Nursing Education Conference at Columbia University in New York City. Liz mentioned her great aunt&rsquo;s concern about the sensitive spirit that is needed, not only in nursing but, in teaching and serving humanity. That jogged my memory about a statement Gordon made several times and that statement, I would say, was the foundation of his career and service in Education.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">So, with the Gray Ghost looking over my shoulder, and in the vein of that sensitive spirit, I close by giving you Gordon Botsford&rsquo;s greatest legacy to us as teachers. It is wrapped up in a one sentence directive to all who teach and serve children. I quote: Remember, as a teacher, in your hands you hold the most fragile, precious, and irreplaceable commodity on this earth, someone else&rsquo;s child. Thank you, Gordon Botsford.</span></p>

			<p align="center"><span lang="EN-CA"><font face="Arial" size="5"><font face="Arial" size="5">Alexandra Zabjek</font></font></span></p>

			<p align="center"><span lang="EN-CA"><font face="Arial">Edmonton Journal </font></span></p>

			<p align="center"><span lang="EN-CA"><font face="Arial">December 19, 2015 </font></span></p>

			<p><span lang="EN-CA"><font face="Arial">In a province where parents paid $250 million in school fees this fall, Brad Burns has achieved a small coup: almost no fees for students at Highlands School for the past two years. </font></span></p>

			<p><span lang="EN-CA"><font face="Arial">When Burns became principal at the northeast Edmonton junior high a few years ago, fees were being collected sporadically or not at all. Instead of pressuring some students to pay up for an art class or a graduation ceremony, Burns has tried his best to eliminate the payments for everyone. </font></span></p>

			<p><span lang="EN-CA"><font face="Arial">&quot;It&#39;s not really fair to say we charge no fees - kids pay for their bus passes and there are small fees for being on teams,&quot; Burns said on Friday. &quot;But as far as curriculum - art fees, construction fees, home economics fees, textbook rental, technology - those fees that a lot of other schools charge, we don&#39;t charge any.&quot; </font></span></p>

			<p><span lang="EN-CA"><font face="Arial">The department of education this week released data showing that parents across Alberta typically pay hundreds of dollars for everything from lunchtime supervision to text-book rentals to field trips. Parents with several school-aged children may spend more than a thousand dollars on fees in September. </font></span></p>

			<p><span lang="EN-CA"><font face="Arial">Education Minister David Eggen has said he&#39;s considering government support to reduce &quot;essential school&quot; fees and he will ask school boards to brainstorm on how to reduce others. textbooks than it is to actually buy textbooks.&quot; </font></span></p>

			<p><span lang="EN-CA"><font face="Arial">At the Highlands school, Burns has brainstormed, networked, collaborated and literally driven around the city to minimize fees as much as possible. </font></span></p>

			<p><span lang="EN-CA"><font face="Arial">He visits grocery stores and bakeries around the city on Tuesday nights to collect day-old bread and produce for the school&#39;s breakfast and lunch programs, which serve more than 60 per cent of the .school&#39;s 198 students. The program is open to everyone. </font></span></p>

			<p><span lang="EN-CA"><font face="Arial">The meals also happen because of partnerships with Metis Child and Family Services, the United Way&#39;s All in for Youth Initiative, and the children&#39;s fund from the radio station, the Bear, Burns said. If parents can afford it, they&#39;re asked to send their children with lunch or contribute food or money to the program. </font></span></p>

			<p><span lang="EN-CA"><font face="Arial">Another big cost-cutting move at the school has been the transition to electronic textbooks whenever possible. Many schools charge $75 for textbook rentals, with the money going to cover the books, licensing fees and computer programs. </font></span></p>

			<p><span lang="EN-CA"><font face="Arial">&quot;We just found it costs less to do than to buy the paper copy and then you don&#39;t have any damage, so you don&#39;t need to charge the rental fee,&quot; Burns said. &quot;We put a lot of our effort and energy into making sure that kids have access to technology in the school, so that brings down our cost of textbooks, so we can do all of our textbooks online. It&#39;s a far </font></span></p>

			<p><span lang="EN-CA"><font face="Arial">less cost to have a site licence for textbooks than it is to actually buy textbooks.&quot; </font></span></p>

			<p><span lang="EN-CA"><font face="Arial">Students may pay a small school fee for field trips but the parent council also fund raises for such activities, or for events such as a September barbecue. </font></span></p>

			<p><span lang="EN-CA"><font face="Arial">&quot;Brad has done an amazing job at taking his budget and strategically applying it to what is the greatest benefit for the students,&quot; said Tracy Potter-MacSwain, who chairs the school&#39;s parent council. </font></span></p>

			<p><span lang="EN-CA"><font face="Arial">&quot;We&#39;re fund raising for supplemental experiences, we&#39;re not providing the basics ... there&#39;s no lack there, the kids are having great experiences, they&#39;re doing a lot of things, and they have access to technology and things are up to date.&quot; </font></span></p>

			<p><span lang="EN-CA"><font face="Arial">Potter- MacSwain said eliminating many school fees is a &quot;great reduction in stress,&quot; for both wealthy families and those that are financially struggling. </font></span></p>

			<p><span lang="EN-CA"><font face="Arial">Burns&quot; who has previously worked at Victoria School for the Arts and Old Scona High School, said there are families that struggle with fees at every school. </font></span></p>

			<p><span lang="EN-CA"><font face="Arial">&quot;I get where fees come in &ndash; I don&#39;t fault anyone for charging them, Some programs and offerings cost a lot of money and it will often fall outside the realm of what a school can pay for, to offer that level of programming,&quot; he said. </font></span></p>

			<p><span lang="EN-CA"><font face="Arial">&quot;But my personal philosophy is that a fee should never prevent someone from taking a course. I&#39;d never want a student to not choose art because they can&#39;t afford a $25 art fee, or not take construction, or foods, ... I&#39;d rather make it completely accessible to all students, and then figure it out.&quot; </font></span></p>
