			<p style="text-align: justify"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><b>NOVEMBER 16 2012:</b> The process of &#39;posting&#39; these pictures brought back loads of memories of over 50 years ago. They reminded me that on my last rating I was told I was a good (lance) sergeant but had to learn to get the men to do the work and for me to supervise. Didn&#39;t make any difference: I am a hands on kind of fellow and like to get stuck-in! It also reminded me of having to post the piquet at Montgomery Barracks in Berlin and &#39;standing idly&#39; and talking with the guardsman I was going to &#39;post&#39;. Drill Sergeant Fred Clutton must have observed the conversation because he called me over and gave me a little friendly advice...&#39;don&#39;t be (too) familiar with lower ranks&#39;. I have never forgotten the incident (or the Drill Sgt. for that matter) but had forgotten his advice.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Having received this last rating I was marched out then back again as it was nearing then end of my three years. This second marching in was to encourage me to reenlist..... I declined... I just caught the end of the officer&#39;s conversation as I was being marched in...&quot; he (me) seemed a little upset.... </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">I can see looking back that we (the rank and file) were really not fully aware of the &#39;cold war&#39; situation existing at the time. We played war games...hiding in trenches, facing away from any atomic blast.. as my dear old Dad might have said... a fat lot of good that will do you! Map reading was almost nonexistent, and, apart from the usual weapons training there was not much else. I remember going to, I think Sennelager for a machine gun competition... I don&#39;t think the platoon did too badly... but there was no actual simulated war situations.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">We were woefully informed on exercises in Germany... it was like the &#39;blind leading the blind&#39;...and I imagine the senior NCO&#39;s also felt like mushrooms. Please do not think that I feel we would not have performed well in any action. I am just saying the preparation was pretty lax...even in the Middle East for the Suez fiasco. We did some field training when I was with 3 Company before being moved to Support. It consisted of, and I can&#39;t remember the numbers, but I remember the officer telling me he needed the &#39;bren on the left&#39;. To give covering fire... (my recollection was that one sought some kind of cover for the crew) I could find nothing resembling cover in the rocky field we were in... afterwards he thought I had taken the crew too far away... I explained the &#39;seeking the cover&#39; idea... and nothing more was said. The &#39;assault&#39; was finished of with the standard &#39;fix bayonets and fire every 10(?)yards&#39;... Hmmm! Ah, well, all&#39;s well that ends well! </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">I must admit the idea of a Vicker&#39;s Machine Guns on a minesweeper added a little bit of interest...particularly for me!</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Now it&#39;s time to have a look at the photographs... should you recognize anyone, or can add any information, please contact me at the email address below...</font></p>

His job was not the easiest one in the world but he tackled it with diligence. He ensured we went through all the the phases of getting &quot;leave to fall in&quot; ... you will remember... &#39;do your feet hurt&#39; if you were too soft in bringing your feet in, and some other remark if too loud... As I look back it was not the best job in the world although there must have been some benefits. He ensured we did not get to the NAAFI too often unless there was something for him. We were not supposed to volunteer for anything while in training but I and a couple of others did for cricket...that did not last too long. And occasionally there was the suggestion of him going on a long weekend but being sort of funds and that it would be a miserable weekend for us if... I would actually have liked to have met him again: I would have bought him a brew. I met Sgt, Whitehead again in the sergeants mess in D&uuml;sseldorf. So from my perspective they both did an excellent job...</span></span></p>

Hmmm. I guess we were not the brightest of squads, we had a couple of monumental chasing... with the rifle in an odd position... we even had the pleasure of the CSM for company! I think this happened, in fact I am sure it happened before Sgt. Whitehead arrived on the scene! He certainly did not need any help in ensuring our feet did not touch the ground...for the first week after he took over our squad after we had flunked our 4<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><sup>th</sup><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>week inspection.

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Pirbright, where we were treated as humans again, quite a change from the last 12, no, 13 weeks at the Depot! Food, good food and lots of it. Fresh air! Sgt Page treated us well. I have fond memories! The route march! The trip to Pickering where I was almost arrested with Guardsman Bob Piney! We innocently purchased &#39;fish and chips&#39; and were walking smartly through the village. We were confronted by a Lance Sergeant who promptly told us that if he did not have a &#39;hot date&#39; lined up he would have &#39;placed us in close arrest&#39;. The food was hastily deposited in a garbage container and we (Bob and I) really wondered what all the fuss was about.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">One other &#39;incident&#39; occurred during the &#39;Bivouac Camp&#39; (name supplied by Sgt Brenchley...good man!) We were &#39;listening&#39; for the enemy and sure enough there loomed one of the squad lance sergeant&#39;s, leading a night patrol, looking for prisoners... I received a sharp blow the the side of the head... but eluded this man.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">I also noted at Pickering the unique way of placing margarine (I almost said butter!) on bread... you will remember. It was melted to a liquid and applied with a paint brush.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">You will remember of course, the &quot;Sing or Double&quot; command... it seemed that there was just long enough between the last word of the command and time to think of a song before you were doubling...it is recalled the theme song from <i>High Noon</i> got some severe handling.. and one learned the slower the tempo of the song the better for the pace...that is if you ever got to sing... There were two other places of remembrance... the tunnel that one was sent through and a fire was lit at either end... and the hill where one sergeant stood at the bottom, one at the top, and I think one in the middle... all seemed to take perverse delight in doubling us up and down the hill... funny, I did not remember any animosity on our parts... brain washed at last! And then the ramps one had to run up and jump off from the top... invariably someone balked, always the same person(s)... and the smelly pond, where someone was destined to get wet! Ah, those were the days! I never did get the hang of screaming slamming my bayonet into a sand bag.. I have a sneaking suspicion though had the sandbag shown more life I might have been encouraged.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">There too was the competition(?) between the squad NCOs and the Amourer&#39;s section... the first group wanted you to slam your rifle butt into the ground every time you jumped and landed; the others who went berserk as each bump realigned the sights on the rifle... not that the rifle was particularly accurate... I trooped many times at the range! And of course you will remember your turn in the butts...and keeping and adding to the score... and the &#39;efficient&#39; radios used...(the 2 tin cans and string would have been more effective!) I can think it was only due to a Higher Power that we actually came through WW II on the winning side!</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Overall Pirbright and Pickering fashioned us into a unit (2 squads) worthy of the name Grenadiers.</font></p>
