			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" pbzloc="67" size="3">Recorded as Tedridge, Tidridge, Titherridge and possibly others, this is an English surname. It is locational and of medieval origin and describes a person who lived &#39;atta ridge,&#39; which is also the name of a now apparently &quot;lost&quot; medieval village in the Hampshire area. Locational surnames are usually &#39;from&#39; names. That is to say names given to people after they left their original village to move somewhere else.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Spelling over the centuries being at best erratic and local accents very thick, soon lead to the development of &#39;sounds like&#39; surname spellings. In this case examples of the name development over the centuries and taken from the surviving registers of the county of Hampshire include William Titherige of Cheriton, on November 18<sup>th</sup> 1705, James Tidridge, a witness at New Alresford Independent Church on October 12<sup>th</sup> 1834, whilst on February 4<sup>th</sup> 1844, Jane Tedridge, the daughter of Henry and Ann was christened at Bishops Waltham. The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of John Titheridge. This was dated June 13<sup>th</sup> 1642 when he married Erne Garret at Bighton, North Petersfield, during the reign of King Charles 1<sup>st</sup> of England, 1625 1649.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Surnames became necessary when governments introduced personal taxation. In England this was sometimes known as the Poll Tax. Throughout the centuries, surnames in every country have continued to &quot;develop&quot; often leading to astonishing variants of the original spelling.</font></font></p>

It is hoped this will not confuse issues. It should also be noted that the Tidridge clan enjoys(?) many and varied spellings of their names.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: left"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">To <b>John and Maureen TIDRIDGE</b>.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: left">&nbsp;</p>

			<p style="text-align: left"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Dear <b>John and Maureen</b>,</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">As one family history fanatic to another, may I congratulate you John, in your capacity of editor, on a superb web site. It is quite the best that I have ever seen.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">I had best start by explaining how I know <b>Ivan and Phyl</b>. I was born on 22<sup>nd</sup> June 1935. I was a police officer for 28 years and 9 months. The whole of my service was in the uniformed branch. I joined the Southampton City Police in 1955, serving in the Central and Bitterne divisions. In 1967, Southampton amalgamated with the Hampshire Constabulary, and the following year I was promoted to Sergeant and moved to Petersfield. Ivan was then a beat motorcyclist for the A3 road, stationed at Petersfield and living in Buriton. For the next two years, I worked closely with him. He then moved to Oz in 1970. At about the same time, another Petersfield P.C. <b>Tony HARDING</b> also resigned and moved to Perth. My wife and I are close friends of the HARDINGs, and we have kept in touch with them over the years. In 1987, we visited them in Perth, and whilst we were there, we all met up with Ivan and Phyl, and had a meal out together. This was the last contact that we had with Ivan and Phyl. We have seen the HARDINGs several times on their visits to the UK, the last time being in April this year. </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Like yourself, John, I have lived a very full life, and our two careers have been similar in some respects. I attended Prices Grammar School at Fareham from 1946 - 1952. I then worked with Southampton Libraries for 15 months, before doing my national service. This 15 months turned out to be a most important factor in my life, for years later, when I was approaching my retirement from the police, I was allowed to &quot; buy back &quot; this period of service for a ridiculously small sum of money, and was thus able to retire from the force with a 30 year maximum pension after 28 years and 9 months service. I had been promoted to the rank of Inspector in 1975, and served at Fratton (Portsmouth), Alton, and Cosham (Portsmouth) before retiring in 1984. We continued to live at Petersfield for this period, but on retirement we moved to our present home which is a 1960&#39;s built bungalow on a very pleasant quiet estate at Horndean, right on the boundary </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">with Cowplain. Whilst I have no regrets about being a policeman - after all, when all&#39;s said and done, it is a very interesting job - I had had more than enough by 1984, and I was relieved to be able to retire with my physical and mental health intact. Whilst I have no regrets about being a policeman - after all, when all&#39;s said and done, it is a very interesting job - I had had more than enough by 1984, and I was relieved to be able to retire with my physical and mental health intact.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">I then did nothing for almost two years, but in 1986 I took up a position as senior assistant at Havant Museum., a branch of the Hampshire County Council museum service. There, I found my true niche in life, and I became very much &quot;into&quot; local and family history. In 1992/93, I attended part time at King Alfred&#39;s College,Winchester, where I obtained an advanced certificate in English local history (equivalent to one third of a degree !) At about the same time, I started to seriously investigate my own family history. I very rapidly became totally hooked on this, and &quot;although I says it as shouldn&#39;t&quot; as my old Mum used to say, I have become a very successful family historian. In a most perverse manner, there is no doubt that my condition of Parkinson&#39;s disease has been a major factor in this. The silver lining to this particular cloud in my life has been the sheer amount of time which it has enabled me to spend on my &quot;hobby&quot;. It has now become the equivalent of a full time job with lot of overtime ! </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">I finally retired in June 2000 at the age of 65 years. I have the dubious honour of being Hampshire&#39;s longest ever serving employee. 44 years, or 46 if national service is included.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">All of which brings me to probably the most important thing which I have to discuss with you. I note with very great interest the fact that you were born at Hedge End, and also the horticultural background of your forbears there.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">My mother, <b>Ivy Nesta TOMLIN</b> was born in Southampton in 1908 Her father <b>William</b> (1863 - 1928) was a grocer, but he came from a family of market gardeners at Hedge End. His father, my GGF <b>Charles</b>, is shown on the 1881 census as a market gardener, as is his son <b>Frank</b>, aged 13 yrs. I believe that Frank continued with the business after his father retired. Surely therefore the <b>TOMLINs, CLARKs and TIDRIDGEs</b> would have known each other ?</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Do you have the Hampshire Gen Soc journal for May of this year ? If you do you will find an article in there by me concerning my friendship with a <b>Rodney WHALE</b>. (<b>Ivan</b> may in fact know of <b>Rodney</b>. He was promoted to Sergeant in the same year as myself, and went to Andover as Traffic Sergeant, staying there in that job for the rest of his time in the Force. He still lives at Andover.)</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Anyway, Rodney is also a fellow FH fanatic, and he is quite an expert on Hedge End. His wife <b>Beryl nee SHARP</b> has SHARP ancestors in the village, and she and I are distantly related. I am forwarding a copy of this message to Rodney to see what he makes of it all.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Returning briefly to my earlier life, I must also mention my national service, where it would appear, John, that you followed in my footsteps ! Whilst I was only a humble Royal Artillery clerk, I served in the Suez Canal Zone for twelve months from February 1954 to February 1955. I spent most of my time there at Fayid beside the Great Bitter Lake. Whilst stationed there, I took two weeks leave in Kyrenia in Cyprus. Almost fifty years ago now - where have the years gone ? ! Thirty years on, in 1984, whilst on holiday in Egypt, Marion and I spent a magical day researching my roots. We hired a taxi in Cairo, and went to Fayid, where we found the remains of the camp.. Several of the more substantial buildings, such as the cinema were still standing and in use for other purposes. We then raced the ships along the canal to Ismailia. The enduring memory there is nervously sipping a coke in a cafe surrounded by gentlemen puffing on their hubbly bubbly pipes. All in all, a fantastic day - we did not see another white face between leaving and returning to our hotel.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">In 1990, we had two weeks holiday at Kyrenia in Northern Cyprus. This has changed little over the years. Neither has the view from St. Hilarion castle, which has surely got to be one of he most beautiful in the world !</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Well, I had better pack up now or I will never get this off. I still have one most important (to me) matter which I would like to discuss with you concerning a GGF who emigrated to Canada in 1911, but that&#39;s going to have to wait till next time.</font></p>

			<p><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Kind regards. <b>Gavin and Marion MAIDMENT</b></font></p>

			<p><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">MAIDMENT Gavin Paul Died suddenly but peacefully on 30 July, aged 75 years after suffering with Parkinson&#39;s for many years. Dearly loved husband of Marion, father to Angela, Kim and Mark. </font></p>

The book is about the neighbourhood he lives in and describes the parks, memorial benches and the like.

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The book launch took place in the Highlands Park and the launch was part of the celebration of the 100 <sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Highlands subdivision.

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The project started as simply gathering facts for his family website.

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The initial attempt was through the Highlands Community League and a meeting with the then Executive looked promising.

The Highlands Community League executive took up the challenge and endorsed the idea with some concrete support in the way of finances.</span></p>

Martowski, who with Yvette now became the driving force behind the idea of getting thew book into print. As always, finances were a problem, or rather the lack thereof. Although the League had been generous in helping and the Northlands group had made funds available with some requirements, funding was short. An effort to involve the local business people did not work out well and in hindsight, that was to be expected. Why would they sponsor an unknown? It became obvious that some other financial means were needed and an anticipated launch of June was becoming obviously more and more impossible. .</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">While all this had been going on Barb. Martowski had sought and found, as she called them, &#39;angels&#39;. Boyd and Laura England, were &#39;interested&#39; in becoming involved. Subsequent meetings revealed they were in fact prepared to become the publishers of the book. Tidridge had persistently called the effort a booklet...until severely reprimanded by Martowski.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Several meetings later all plans were in place and the book was set to be launched September 15 <sup>th</sup> 2012. The group was saddened that Yvette had to withdraw because of other commitments. The financial aid of the League and Northlands had to be declined because of the emergence of the publisher.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">September 15 <sup>th</sup> dawned early (it usually does!)looked promising... sunny and warm. Coming to the Park, Tidridge found a table and signs had been set up by Boyd. We were in business!! The launch was scheduled to take place between 11.00 a.m. and 2 p.m. The first book was sold before the official opening to Isaac Tyler, Tidridge&#39;s grandson... People came and went some commented some merely looked and walked away... another author Murray Hoak (?) passed by and suggested the stall occupants (Tidridge and Boyd) should be more aggressive and almost demand people buy... they graciously demurred...but did step up the pitch ever so slightly.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px">&nbsp;</p>

			<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">By the end of the session we were talking reprints...</span></p>

Most often entry was through the back yard... Dad and I would leave our bikes there when we went to a soccer game at the Dell which was just down the street from the home.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The garden was quite small, a lawn and flower beds is all I recall... you walked along the path and came to the back door, on your right. You entered into the kitchen, then into the dining room...both rooms seemed large. Leaving the dining room there was a bedroom on the left then the front parlour. The stairs were on the right... the front door straight ahead. I only vaguely remember going up stairs... the house always seemed dark to me. Across the street was a walled premise I believe the Deanery School were granddad was the head gardener. The church was down the street, turning right coming out the front door.</span></p>

			<br />
			Before my mind could hold the memory,<br />
			Grandad pours the tea.<br />
			When I was no taller, and still smaller than his knee,<br />
			Grandad pours the tea.<br />
			Playing in the garden, hide and seek,<br />
			Grandad pours the tea.<br />
			Sunday afternoon, gentle summer breeze,<br />
			Grandad pours the tea.<br />
			Storms of youth, like a troubled sea,<br />
			Grandad pours the tea.<br />
			Out into the world, joy and pain, war and peace,<br />
			Grandad pours the tea.<br />
			Warm sunshine, falling leaves,<br />
			Grandad pours the tea.<br />
			Frosty air, buds on the trees,<br />
			Grandad pours the tea.<br />
			At the beginning and at the end of everything,<br />
			Grandad pours the tea.<br />
			<br />
			You see,<br />
			There is so much more inside a cup of tea,<br />
			Than milk,<br />
			And the hint of spicy dried leaves:<br />
			Tea warms the soul,<br />
			One sip,<br />
			And you know you are home.<br />
			<br />
			Tea brings light,<br />
			The easing of pain,<br />
			Tea soothes a long night,<br />
			And brings a new day.<br />
			<br />
			Tea is fondness and care,<br />
			A steadfastness and loyalty,<br />
			A promise to remain there.<br />
			<br />
			All of this is found,<br />
			In the heart and the hands,<br />
			Who has served us so many years of tea,<br />
			Grandad.<br />
			<br />
			So Grandad, please know,<br />
			When you come to our homes,<br />
			And WE pour you a cup to sip and to hold,<br />
			It is in the hopes that we,<br />
			Can repay just a drop of the love,<br />
			You have poured into our family,<br />
			Through the tradition of tea.</div>
