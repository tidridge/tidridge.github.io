His father, <b>Harry (Henry) Tidridge</b> was a gardener and Harry John followed in these footsteps at first. He worked as a gardener at Minstead in the New Forest for a few years and then as head gardener to Canon Wilberforce at the Deanery, Southampton.

This sundial was recovered when St. Marks was demolished and presented to his son, <b>Walter Sidney Tidridge</b>.

Behind the stumps, Arnold Zinn had a good day, with three catches and two stumpings. So unthinkable as to be ridiculous. Yet - replace the names in the above passage by those of local aldermen and Councillors from the past, and you could have report from this paper 50 years ago.

Forty-five years ago, when the head gardener to Canon Wilberforce, at the Deanery, Southampton, he was appointed verger of St. Mary&#39;s Church, a post he held for six years. Even before that when working at Minstead he had been in the Church choir there, and on one Sunday during that time a strange incident occurred. The choir, situated in a gallery at the back of the church , had the assistance of a violinist, a man with a wooden leg. While playing he kept time with his wooden leg, and in the course of many Sundays the boards wore thin under the constant beating. On one Sunday, when the choir&#39;s singing was rather ragged the wooden leg beat harder, with the result that the boards gave way and the wooden stump going through , displaced a quantity of plaster, which fell with a clatter by the side of the player of the harmonium. Unused to such interruptions, the lady organist fainted. </font></font></p>

Tidridge, I may not be able to help much but it brought back many happy childhood memories.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">My parents moved down here in 1922 from Newcastle on Tyne, when I was six years old. Although my father was only 30 he was a keen bowler, know as an &#39;old man&#39;s game&#39; in those days. He joined the Atherley Bowling Club at the Civil Service Club (&amp; Sports Ground) not far from the Dell. Your uncle as greenskeeper there and I spent many happy hours playing with him when taken round by my father.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Soon after that Atherley purchased land in Hill Lane facing the Common. It was large enough to accommodate 2 greens attractively landscaped, a commodious Club House and four tennis courts which they leased out. &quot;Tid&quot; as he was known to everyone was the greenskeeper till he retired . They&#39;ve certainly not had another to compare with him. It was his life and he did not regard it an as 9-5 job. The greens and surroundings were always tip-top. I don&#39;t think he married, and lived with his father in Silverdale Road, next to the Dell. By coincidence I attended a large Private School, whose playing fields faced Silverdale Rd. and next St,. Marks C of E Parish Church. As a school we had to attend certain services and the verger was &quot;Tid&#39;s&quot; father. I remember he had a white beard (naturally he appeared elderly) to me. We regarded him with great respect. St. Mark&#39;s was very well attended being in a very exclusive residential area, but those days are gone. Last year the church was demolished for house buildup.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Unfortunately all the old bowlers who perhaps could have told you more about &quot;Tid&quot; are no longer with us. My mother aged 96, remembers him well but my father has been dead for 30 years.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">As a matter of fact Atherley now has large Indoor Bowling Section and a Social Club, having used the tennis court land.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">I hope this is a little bit of family news for you. I can assure you &quot;Tid&quot; was very highly respected. Maybe some else will come up with further information.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">I knew a Mr. Tidridge or Titheridge in the 1920-1930 as he was then verger of St. Mark&#39;s Church in Archers Rd. next to the Dell just down from where he lived in Silverdale Rd. whether he was a grounds man as well I do not know as I was a Choir Boy at the church in those days, but my father took over the job when he died in the thirties (?)</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">But there is or was a Man called &quot;Eddie Place&quot; who lived in Kentish Rd. Freemantle, who lived in the same house or near it in Silverdale Rd in those days</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Now the Vicar&#39;s name was Mr. Brummitt or Brumit the old Church had just been pulled down and built on, but there is a smaller church still there by the Dell.</font></font></p>
