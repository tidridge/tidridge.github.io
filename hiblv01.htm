<p>Hello John,</p>
<p>We will do this one school at a time.
<br>Bellevue School opened in 1950.
<br>It was named after the district.
<br>It closed in 2003.
<br>Address is 11515 - 71 street.</p><hr>

<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">Bellevue is one of the City's smaller neighbourhoods, Bellevue was developed prior to 1950. Eastglen Composite High School, which serves students in much of east central Edmonton, is a dominant feature of the area (though a high proportion of area residents are over the age of 60 or retirees).</p> 
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">Bellevue is highlighted by stunning views of the river valley and the city skyline.</p><br clear=all><hr>

<p style="text-indent:50px">My recommendations are in each case that the lowest tender received and the firms are well established, reliable contractors. The Prudham Construction Company has carried out several contracts for the Board with entire satisfaction and Young Electric Co. are successors to the firm S.E.

Pat Fizell, Principal
Bellevue School</center></p>              
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">The last month or so has continued to be jam-packed with authentic learning adventures for all our students. Ms. Lopatinski's "Meet the Shapleys" project challenged Grade 1 and 2 students to apply geometry skills using a problem solving approach. The children were highly engaged in mathematics, language arts and art as they designed, created and described their own "Shapley Family" world.</p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify"> Our Grade 3 and 4 students investigated Natives in North America through field work integrating cultural anthropology, science, language arts, art and music. Bellevue parent Anna Curtis enriched the project, as did support from Human Resources Development Canada, EPSB Native Liaison Consultant Edith Dalla Costa and Strathcona Wilderness Centre personnel. Besides building a 12-foot teepee, our junior anthropologists created reports and displays describing what life was like 900 years ago.</p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">Students in grades 5 and 6 enriched their studies through several field experiences. Miss Jespersen and students used University of Alberta Museums and Collections to learn about archeological research, explore artifacts and prepare reports, presentations and displays depicting life in Ancient Greece. Research into aerodynamics and flight with Mr. Goulden was also a hit. Guest presenters included a professional pilot from Kenn Borek Aviation who used actual model aircraft to demonstrate his points. Students created research reports and displays to share their knowledge of aerodynamics, including flight before aviation. 
Highlands Library visited us twice, hosting Young Readers' Choice Awards voting for students in grades 3 through 6 on March 21 and an author visit by Karleen Bradford on April 11. Bellevue students are learning to read and reading to learn.</p>

<p><center><b>Bellevue Elementary: The 'perfect' school... closes</b>
<br>By John Tidridge</center></p>
With many thanks to City of Edmonton and Edmonton Pubic School Board Archives and Communications
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify"> Some school closures are alright, especially during those lazy days of summer, when the last thing a student wants is to attend classes!! Closing a school permanently, however, evokes many memories-some good, some bad. What follows is a mixture of mainly good (plus some not-so-good) memories connected to Bellevue Elementary School.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">Speaking at official opening ceremonies on Dec. 2, 1950, Mr. H. B. Fowler, chairman of the Edmonton School Board property committee, said Bellevue elementary school had been made as perfect as is humanely possible. As reported by the Edmonton Bulletin, he also said a high school, with technical shops, would open in the adjacent grounds.	The school, which had been open since the previous September, would accommodate 400 pupils and 10 teachers. The school's first principal, Mr. R. Prichard, presided at the opening. Mr. R. H. Rae, chairman of the Edmonton public school board indicated the city was trying to keep its education facilities apace with growth. Mr. W. F. Quilley, president of the Bellevue Home and School Association, talked of the vital part this organization could play in the future life of the new school.</p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify"> A woman who served the school as secretary for 16 years is among those who recall happy memories. A cooperative and enthusiastic staff and interesting (had a bit of a struggle for the right word!!) children, immediately came to mind. She also recalled a sparkling clean school, a sign of efficient custodians. She particularly remembered the 50th Anniversary where bulletin boards covered with student work lined the hallways. The Minister of Education at the time, David King, was a speaker for the occasion. See accompanying article for more school memories.</p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">Seeing into the future: "Bellevue school reunion could be its last," proclaims a headline in the Edmonton Journal of June 9, 1981. Reunion organizer Marilyn Cross, a former student, is quoted as saying, "With enrollment going down the school may disappear, so this is sort of our last kick at the cat." The article quotes Audrey Clark, the principal, saying that enrollment was just over 70 and she fears closure may be just around the corner.</p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">Closure became reality at the May 27, 2003 meeting of the Edmonton Public School Board Trustees.</p><hr>
<p><center><b>Milestones (?) in the history of Bellevue School</b></center></p>

<br>b. Trustee Hansen suggested the the administration consider providing students with transportation at no extra costs.</q></p><hr>
<p><b> School closure policy
<br><i>Excerpted from Edmonton Public School Board Policies and Regulations</i></b>
<br> The board believes that the closure of schools is an important consideration in ensuring the responsible use of the resources placed in its trust; making efficient use of the district's school space and safeguarding the health and safety of students, staff and the public
<br> The board reserves to itself the authority to close an entire school  or three or more consecutive grades in a school...
<br>An entire school of three or more consecutive grades in  a school may be considered for closure if one or more of the following criteria are met (criteria abbreviated)
<p>1.	for elementary schools, an average of 15 or fewer students per grade;
<br>2.	less than 40 per cent of the space is utilized;
<br>3.	unreasonably high costs of keeping/making the school operable
<br>4.	building presents health and safety concerns;
<br>5.	parents and guardians of a majority of students agree closure should be considered.</p>

<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">"As the weather warms up, the students and their teachers plan to plant flowers, put up bird feeders, and weave birds nests from twigs at the park," says teacher Linda Parasiuk.  The students started the project on Earth Day, April 22, and will continue to keep the park clean in the coming years, Parasiuk says. Students and teachers also plan to get together during summer vacation months to care for plant life and pick up litter at the park.</p>

<p><center><b>Memories of Bellevue School</b>
<br>Marilyn Cross</center></p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">I attended Bellevue from grades 1 through 6 (there was no kindergarten). My Grade 1 class had 30 students. We were in Room 8 with Miss McDonald, who attended our 50th Reunion.</p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">Grade 1 students usually received a tree on Arbour Day in June. In my Grade 1 year, the Minister of Education came to Bellevue and with the entire school body of over 300 students on the front lawn planted the elm tree that now sits majestically by our front entrance.</p>
<img src="highsc06.jpg" width=300 height=217 vspace=10 hspace=10 align=right alt="The May Tree">
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify"> The school was full to the brim. In fact, there was no music room, no library, no staff room-just classrooms and portables. The playground consisted of monkey bars, teeter totter, a roundabout and uneven bars at the south end of the school where the parking lot is now located. 
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify"> Community was important, and the school was enhanced by the way the community supported it. Each year, the School Council would put on a tea for the community in our school gym, with students as waiters. The school also showed movies on Saturday mornings for the students who could return. 
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify"> When my children attended Bellevue, we had become smaller. There were fewer children in the surrounding area because Northlands and the freeway had taken many of the homes in our catchment area. My youngest son was at Bellevue when there were only 45 students. He was in a 3-4-5-6 combined class. The playground by this time had been moved to where it is located now, but we had lost the teeter totter and the roundabout because of safety issues. 
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify"> During the years that followed, as a staff member I saw the school once again grow in numbers to around 150. We were able to put in a new playground for the children in the community. Things bustled-concerts, teas, field trips. But again, enrollment declined. It is with fond memories and a sad heart that I see the last of our students complete their years at Bellevue. <p/><hr>
<p><center><b>More memories...</b>
<br> from a parent/teacher/volunteer, the late Norma Hawley</center></p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify"> Living in our home on 68 Street in 1944, we could believe that we were in a rural area. Facing west, we saw trees and bushes, heard birds, picked flowers and even saw a cow grazing. Northwest we could hear and smell Burn's Packing Plant and regularly hear the train whistle during the night. With the ending of the war all quickly changed, as homes were built in the area for returning veterans and their families. By 1949, it was well settled.</p><img src="highsc07.jpg" width=300 height=218 vspace=10 hspace=10 align=left alt="Bellevue School">
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify"> September 1950 saw the opening of Bellevue School. All classes were filled and in a few years it was necessary to add more rooms to the north end. My three children all attended Bellevue and have many memories of their elementary days. The parents quickly formed a Home and School Association, meeting once a month with staff. I remember good meetings, interesting speakers, plenty of discussion, bake sales to obtain funds for the extra equipment-a busy time for all of us.</p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify"> I joined the staff in 1959 and remained for 15 years. I remember crowded classrooms, work-filled days but many exciting, happy events: Christmas and spring concerts, sport days, Halloween parties, Valentine boxes, class picnics in Borden Park, Grade 6 girls serving tea at their "graduation" afternoon. The Bellevue Community League was also active and there was a close relationship between parents in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify"> Changes took place on the opening of Capilano Bridge and subsequent streets, as blocks of houses were removed and Bellevue lost many families. School attendance rapidly reduced and continued to do so. After leaving the staff, I returned to the school as a volunteer and so have witnessed the decline of the school population. In spite of the low attendance, the excellent teaching and parent cooperation has always been present. After 53 years, Bellevue School will be closed but happy memories will always be with us.</p><hr>

<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify"> So while most of our discussion centred around what is provided and, for whom... and this covered many, many areas, including but not restricted to, working with victims of violence, assisting those whose limited abilities restrict them to very specific tasks, helping to rebuild injury-shattered careers, providing loans to start small businesses, providing free computer and telephone accessibility, teaching people how to complete a résumé, supporting an art program for those with mental health concerns,... that they were funded by a Provincial Government Agency, that they had the cooperation of employers, from varying industries, that they helped employers in the task of developing people, and, that they were very conscious of their position in the community, that a staff of 40-44 people was on the pay roll, that the group started in 1977...all very good and professional... however,  what struck me during the course of the interview was that a tremendous sense of caring existed in this organization, it was not just a place where people came in and were shunted or shuffled through various 'steps', alone and frustrated... Persons were carefully monitored with mentoring both during and after a completed program. A desire to see results in the people... I was impressed!

<p>May 2014: WE GET LETTERS...</p>




<p>May 22, 2014</p>

<p>From New Zealand:</p>

<p>Hi John</p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">Thank you for the memories of the above [Bellevue School} which began for me over 60 years ago as an 11 year old recent arrival from Scotland. Bellevue certainly was ultra modern compared to the school I left behind;  the system was more relaxed and Mr. Pritchard kept order with a paddle bat, less daunting than the four pronged leather strap I was familiar with.</p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">I fondly remember practicing, "Bye Bye Blackbird", for the Christmas Concert.  Unfortunately my time at Bellevue was limited as we moved south to Halkirk, near Stettler and a wonderful but different scholastic environment. I attended Halkirk school which was demolished in 1954. It was a three-room affair, complete with an ice rink. My teacher Miss. Bernhart read to the class after lunch to settle the students down. As far as businesses Halkirk consisted of a hotel, a general store and pool hall and the butchery. My father managed the butchery. The grain elevator doubled as a barber's shop. My father managed the quick freeze plant storing meat for farmers he also assisted with the slaughtering of the animals..</p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">We attended the Church of the Nazarene. It is interesting to note the Doan family whose grandson became Canadian hockey captain were church stalwarts.</p>

<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">New year was celebrates cooking wieners on a bonfire on the ice.</p> 

<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">Unfortunately my mother became homesick and we returned to Scotland. My father must have found the decision difficult because he had found his niche. His employer tried hard to convince him to stay, even taking the family to Banff and staying with his family in Calgary.</p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">We had arrived in Edmonton on the CNR and left Calgary on the CPR. On board the SS Ascania
It's last voyage before the scrap-yard.</p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">We seemed to be the only Europeans heading east; our traveling companions were for the most part West Indians, lovely people full of hope heading for the promised land. as an 11 year old I couldn't help thinking why would they leave palm trees and golden beaches for the smog and grey buildings of London. I know better now.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">We arrived back in Glasgow to snow and sleet. Another chapter in my father's remarkable life.
I attended 4 schools within 12 months; what I missed scholastically was more than compensated with by the people I met.</p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">I came to NZ in 1963 after 3 years in Australia, there is no where I would rather be. 
like you John I am blessed, 6 healthy and interesting grandchildren and a wonderful wife for close to 50 years.</p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">You are welcome to include these letters in the website. .  For the record I have turned 72 and grateful for each new day.  We have just returned from our daily walk along the riverbank on another beautiful morning, although we are approaching midwinter the temp. is 18C, a far cry from a Canadian winter.</p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">Regards,</p>
<p style="text-indent:35px;text-align:justify">Bob Deans</p><hr>
