It was Anufy who thought that it would be good a good idea to hold a 50th Anniversary dinner for the class. He worked on this project first from his home and later, as he was dying of cancer, from his hospital room/bed at St. Joseph&#39;s Auxiliary Hospital. Anufy kept lots of notes: Including the speech he would give at the reunion dinner. The speech has been edited. [It was a little embarrassling for Tidridge; he visited &#39;Anufy in hospital and was told he had forgotten who was the MC at the actual graduation...It was difficult to tell Anufy he was looking at the MC!] So what follows is the speech that was meant to be!</font></font></font></font></p>

I graduated to property car and patrolled various districts throughout the city. In my third year I (was) transferred to H.Q. Communications Section (staying) for 2 years. I then moved back to Patrol and was assigned to a 2-man complaint car for at least 5 more years and (was) transferred back to Communications for 4 more years. I had lots of time to study for promotion. After 4 years in Communications I asked for a transfer back to patrol, as that&#39;s where the promotions happen. In 1972 I was promoted to sergeant but had the option to take plain clothes (detective). I spent 11 years in the Criminal Investigation Division in various sections. I even assisted with arrests in the Drug Section.</font></font></font></font></p>

I had the choice of 2 sections to work in Downtown H.Q. (1) was the Jail Section and (2) was the Information and Reception. I chose the latter. You met more interesting people. The shifts were also very good, a 4 day week, 12 hour shifts, (but there were) more days off. I spent 5 years in this section and enjoyed every bit (of it). I even got to sneak away for a few games of pool in the Sergeants&#39;Lounge on the night shift. Who said police was all work and no play. I retired under Chief Chahley on the 29 December 1989 and have never looked back.</font></font></font></font></p>

I walked into his office; dropped him my desk key, cut him a cheque for my expense account, walked out and never looked back.</font></font></font></font></p>
