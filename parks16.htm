						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">John Herbert &quot;Bert&quot; Haswell, believed to be the oldest working plumber in Canada, died January 12, 2005, at the age of 91. Haswell, who died Wednesday of influenza, made his last service call on New Year&#39;s Eve installing a new toilet for a customer, says daughter Darlene Vassos. &quot;Then he went dancing.&quot; </font></font></p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">He couldn&#39;t stop working because he didn&#39;t want to let his customers down, Vassos said, though he joked with Cliff Chow, his number 1 customer, that when he turned 100 he might finally put his plunger away for good. Haswell was Chow&#39;s plumber for 45 years. &quot;No matter what day of the week or what time of day you called him he was always there,&quot; Chow said, though maybe not right away.</font></font></p>

						<p style="text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Besides his trademark bow tie, Haswell came to be known for always being late. &quot;Be right there,&quot; could mean two days later, Chow said with a chuckle. But his work was always the best. &quot;He was more than my plumber. We became good friends over the years and I miss him.&quot; </font></font></p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Haswell was born in Edmonton in 1913, the oldest of five children. He was 12 when he and his brother, Fred, began learning the family business from their father. &quot;Plumbing runs in the family like wooden legs,&quot; he quipped on his 80<sup>th</sup> birthday. He took over his father&#39;s business in 1956 and renamed it Ability Plumbing. When he turned 65 he saw no reason to retire, arguing that age is just a number.</font></font></p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Bert met Marjorie Cardall at a dance and they married in 1939. Their marriage lasted 56 years. Their family included two children, Darlene and Raymond, 11 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. Marjorie died in 1995. </font></font></p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Rev. John Burrill of Highlands United Church was Bert&#39;s minister and friend, as well as a customer. He says he got to know Bert as the chapel steward. &quot;He was the first one at church to get there and open up and the last one to leave, shutting the lights out. He called himself The Prince of Darkness,&quot; Burrill remembered with a chuckle. He called Bert a saint and &quot;a servant,&quot; saying &quot;if anyone depicted Jesus for me, it was Bert. He had such a reverence for life. If ants needed to be removed from his kitchen he&#39;d vacuum them up, take them to the back alley and let them go.&quot;</font></font></p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">The nonagenarian and widower was a member of the Minus One Club, where he was a popular dance partner with women of all ages. Even men approached him, asking him to dance with their wives because they didn&#39;t dance, Vassos said. Haswell had a good sense of rhythm but was a &quot;free spirit&quot; who made it up as he went along, remembered friend Isobel Duffy. On New Year&#39;s Eve he was the last one off the dance floor, closing the place down at 1 a.m. she said. </font></font></p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">He was also known for his cartooning -- &quot;doodling&quot; he called it, which accented the social club&#39;s newsletters. &quot;He never had a bad thing to say about anyone. He had a great sense of humour. I loved everything about him.&quot; Duffy said. &quot;There&#39;s going to be a big hole (at the club) without him.&quot; </font></font></p>
