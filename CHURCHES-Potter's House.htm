			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">The church is part of a fellowship of 1700 churches around the world. Birthed out of Prescott, Arizona, USA 45 years ago, originally being part of the Four Square Pentecostal Assembly. The church shares the same statement of Faith. The only difference is the church feels called to go where God opens a door to do the Great Commission of Mark 16:15-18.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Edmonton church was pioneered in 1990 and the last building was on 129 Ave and 54 Street. The move to the present place of worship occurred in September 2005. The church believes in reaching the lost, raising up disciples of Jesus Christ and the full moving of the Holy Spirit.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Services: Sunday @ 11:00 A.M and 6:00 P.M., Weds @ 7:30 P.M. doors open 1 hr early for prayer.

			by John Tidridge</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><img align="left" alt="Pastor Les. Theiss" heigth="375" hspace="5" src="pots01.jpg" width="248" wspace="5" />The answering machine talked about carpet cleaning: Either a wrong number or a mixed message&hellip; at least that&rsquo;s what it seemed when I arranged to interview pastor Les. Theiss. It turned out to be the correct number&hellip; but with a mixed message.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Later, meeting with Theiss, the pastor at the Potter&#39;s House Church, it is obvious there is no mixed message, at least not at &#39;his&#39; church. More about that later.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Theiss, I learned was an army brat, born in Winnipeg but spending most of his life in Alberta with atheistic parents. He is married to Debbie, with an 18 year old son, Levi, and 15 year old daughter, Angela.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">In Christian circles, being converted at 32 is a bit of a rarity, but this was Theiss&#39;s experience. It was a dramatic conversion and was coupled with an equally dramatic physical healing. He firmly believes that his lack of any church experience gives him an edge when dealing with others who know nothing of the established church &hellip;he knows what it is like to come in from the cold, as it were!</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Being an active participant in the Potter&rsquo;s House Church means that you have accepted the premise this means to preach, to serve, to heal, and to be mission minded, all the fundamental beliefs of the Church. The fledgling pastor was mentored by a senior minister in the teachings of the church. The church believes that this way of education protects the beliefs of the church being either watered down or changed by teaching removed from the actual church scene. It is their way of protecting what they believe and ensuring the message is properly taught to pastors.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Carpet cleaning for 20-30 hours a week allows Theiss to spend approximately 30 hours working at regular church activities. He is responsible for the operation of the church. Church attendance can vary from 15 to almost 50. There is a service mid-week and two on Sundays. There is outreach into the area, and a youth program.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">His schedule has not allowed him to meet with any of the local church leaders but he supports the view of unity within the Christian Church but is aware that some of his church&rsquo;s views could not be compromised.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Theiss struck me as a man&rsquo;s man, with a handshake of iron&hellip; he gave the impression of a man on a mission who firmly believes that Jesus is the answer! His stress reliever is prayer! He firmly believes that it is Jesus&#39; wish that he preach and he is sure that his message is right on and relevant. I have no doubt about that either!</font></p>
