<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">Virginia Park was one of many areas subdivided during the land boom prior to World War I - but it developed slowly, even though the Highlands streetcar line passed through the neighbourhood. Over 80% of all structures were built before 1950. The neighbourhood contains two prominent landmarks, Concordia College and Borden Park, and the river valley is accessible directly to the south.

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">I have investigated the firm of Haddow and Maughan through Mr. M. C. Dewar, City Architect and he advises me that they are competent and reliable. As their tender is the lowest for the plumbing, heating and ventilating work on both Mill Creek and Virginia Park Schools I would recommend that their tender be accepted by the Board.</p>

<p style="text-indent:20px;text-align:justify">The general contractors, Prudham Construction Co., have sent in their final bills for the above schools, these bills being mostly for release of the 10% holdback. As the required number of days (40) have elapsed since we accepted the schools, it appears to be quite in order to issue cheques in payment. </p>
<p style="text-indent:200px;text-align:justify">One or two small items, however, still require to be carried out or adjusted, and it is proposed to withhold $100.00 from each cheque until these are done in the Spring.</p>

<p style="text-indent:200px;text-align:justify">It is not expected that the final figures will be materially changed from the foregoing amounts. 
<p style="text-indent:200px;text-align:justify">Regarding the contracts for these schools, some members of the Board will recall that the Prudham Construction Co. submitted the only tender on the general construction and that this was awarded on a cost-plus basis. The first plan was for 4 classrooms and auditorium at an estimated cost of $74,000.00, plus $7,000.00 for contractor's fees, but 2 more class-rooms were added, for which the contractor estimated $12,200.00 
plus fee of $1,250.00 These made  an estimated total of $94,450.00 for the general contract. The final total, however, is $120,322.97 for Mill Creek and $123,470.43 for Virginia Pork. The contracts were awarded in November, 1946, and the differences in the above figures represent the increased costs of labor and material between November 1946 1946 and the completion of the contract, plus a contractor's fee of 71/2% throughout the contract. All accounts have been fully supported by original invoices and copies of pay-sheets.</p>

<br> No author listed</p> 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">It's sometimes hard to come up with something special to do for your Dad on Father's Day... but you can't go wrong with a picnic. It's fast, it's easy and it hardly costs a thing. A picnic gets everybody out of the house and gives dads, moms and kids a chance to spend some time together without being interrupted by the phone, the television or the office.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">Today, Small World has a few suggestions for organizing your picnic with dad. Children from Mrs. Allarie's Grade 1 class at Virginia Park Elementary School have come up with some great ideas for picnic foods and activities. Plus we've got an easy Father's Day craft for you to make for dear, old dad.</p> 

<p><center>EX-FUND-RAISER CHARGED WITH THEFT</center></p>
<p>The Edmonton Journal 
<br>Sat Jun 29 1996 
<br>HELEN PLISCHKE, 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">The former head of a parent fund-raising committee at a city elementary school has been charged with stealing about $6,000 from the committee's bank accounts.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">The money raised by the Virginia Park Parent Support Group was to buy computers and library books for about 200 students at Virginia Park elementary school, 73<sup>rd</sup> Street and 109<sup>th</sup> Avenue. 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">Two members of the committee's executive discovered $5,950 missing from bank accounts in February and contacted the police. The former president of the committee was charged in late May with one count of theft over $5,000.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">Unlike parent advisory councils, the support group operates without involvement from the school or the public school board. It strictly performs fund-raising.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">``There's been so much turmoil in our school over this,'' said one past member of the executive, who asked not to be identified. ``There are parents on one side that want justice and others ... who can't believe it, even though charges have been laid.'' </p>
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">The money is alleged to have been stolen in a series of seven unsigned cheques issued to the woman in late June 1995. It's alleged the cheques were made out and cashed in sums of as much as $1,500 each. </p>
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">The former executive member said it took the committee two or three years to raise $6,000.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">``The bottom line is our kids are the ones who suffer. We're just trying to do what's right and moral.''</p> 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">The incident has changed the way the committee, a registered society, operates, she said. ``Now it's 30 angry parents screaming back and forth at each other. It's just been horrible.''</p> 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">Heather Groch, 43, has been charged with one count of theft over $5,000. She is to appear in court July 11. 
<p><center><b>
Allegations shatter trust, friendship of fund-raising group</b></center></p>
<p>The Edmonton Journal 
<br>Sat Feb 22 1997 
Liane Faulder </p>
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">The incident tore a school council apart, shattered friendships and destroyed the trust of a close-knit group of parents. </p>
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">It's over now, sort of. But anyone who has ever had anything to do with fund-raising for a school should pay attention to the debacle at Virginia Park elementary. It could be coming soon to a school near you.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">Last May, Heather Groch, the president of the Virginia Park Parent Support Group, was charged with theft over $5,000 over a whack of money withdrawn from the group's fund-raising accounts. A devoted volunteer at the school for nine years, Groch -- who had cheque-signing authority -- maintained she bought numerous items for the school, including a computer, books and sports equipment.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">Groch said she gave receipts to the support group treasurer for the money in question, money it took the support group nearly three years to raise.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">The treasurer said she received no such receipts. Eventually, police were called and charges laid. Last week, the Crown prosecutor withdrew the charges after reviewing the evidence. 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">But the questions, the hurt, the anger remain and will likely take some time to dissolve.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">The Virginia Park parent support group -- which was incorporated as a society, separate from the school -- was a cozy, tightly knit group which conducted meetings in a casual manner over coffee and operated largely on trust. It was split in two by the controversy.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">
Many parents in the support group backed Groch. Others, including former treasurer Leah Heil, demanded accountability for seven cheques issued directly to Groch. ``We never got our answers,'' maintains Heil.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">``It's been an awful situation,'' says the new board president, Mandi Wisheu, who took over the board last spring when meetings had devolved to name-calling and shouting matches. ``...We're just trying to pick up the pieces and move on.'' </p>
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">Wisheu says ``really bad record-keeping'' meant there wasn't a paper trail when questions arose over the $6,000. </p>
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">She says the old council didn't keep the books up to date on a monthly basis. Wisheu now insists the completed account books are brought to the monthly meetings and checked. The old council kept scrappy records of parent discussions about planned purchases. Now, before a cent is spent, a parent must make a motion, which is recorded. The cheques are written as a group.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">``Our record-keeping is immaculate now,'' says Wisheu.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">
But things are still messy at the school. Jocelyn Peck, a Groch supporter who also volunteered for the fund-raising group, says she no longer feels comfortable in the halls of Virginia Park. Though she volunteered with the school for seven years, she doesn't now.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">``This has created a sense of non-trust within our school.'' 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">Peck and her husband, Bernie, who is a chef and partner at the Iron Bridge restaurant, hosted a fund-raising dinner at the restaurant Wednesday to show their support. About $1,000 was raised towards Groch's $3,000 legal bills.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">And as for Heather Groch? ``It was a terrible year,'' says the 43-year-old mother-of-two who withdrew her son from Virginia Park, worried he'd be affected by the controversy. ``Since the charges were dropped, I've been reliving it all again. When you're on a board in a parent group, not only do you have to deal with these people across the table at a meeting, but also the next day when you pick up the kids at school.'' </p>
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">Mandi Wisheu says not enough volunteers know what they're getting into when they sign on with school groups.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">
They don't know their legal responsibilities, don't realize they are liable for school funds if they have signing authority.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">Such information is available through the Edmonton Public School Board or the Alberta Home and School Councils' Association. The Volunteer Centre of Edmonton will also provide training for a non-profit board.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">The school environment is a delicate one. It reflects small-town life in many ways -- a group of people working towards a common goal, trusting that everyone is heading in the same direction.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">But provincial education cuts have increased pressure on schools to the point where parent support groups like the one at Virginia Park are raising more and more funds to support their children's education. No longer can school fund-raising groups rely on goodwill to keep things straight.</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">What's home? Well, for several weeks Raffaella Montemurro's Grade 4 class at Virginia Park Elementary School called the Edmonton Art Gallery Home. 

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">The students visited the gallery to study the art and then worked in the classroom and right in the gallery, painting and writing as part of project called Writing Home. </p>
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">They studied the work of accomplished artists and writers. Inspired by what they saw, the students did their own poetry and artwork. They also visited the home of artist Lyndal Osborne to learn from her life experience. </p>
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">The project explored the meaning of home, their memories of home and pictures of homes -- both real and imagined. At the end of the project, the class wrote to the gallery as if it was a living, breathing thing. The Writing Home exhibit is on display at the art gallery until September 24.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">Now in Grade 5, a little older and a bit wiser, students Jacob Gramit and Joel Hiebert, 9, along with Kayleen Schnellback, Alanna McAdie and Madeleine Wampler, 10, came back to reflect on work they did last school year and how it affected them.</p> 

<p>What did you do at the gallery? 
<br>Kayleen: We went to the art gallery and wrote on the walls with a special kind of marker that makes it look like chalk. We took a picture in the gallery and sketched or wrote a story. We were there a lot, we'd practise our writing.</p> 
<p>
Did you ever visit your work in the gallery? 
<br>Joel: Once I went with my aunt and uncle and we got in free because they were family.</p>
<p>What did you learn about home? 
<br>Jacob: There are many different places you can live if you let your imagination run wild. Home is anywhere. I could live in here (Virginia Park Elementary School) if I wanted to.
<br>Kayleen: You could live in Wal-Mart if you wanted to.</p>  
<p>Who's your favorite artist? 
<br>Madeleine: I think any art is good art so I don't have a favourite.</p> 
<br>Jacob: I think I'm pretty good. 
<p>What did you like the best about doing the project? 
<br>Joel: We had a poetry cafe and we read poetry to our parents and friends. 
<br>Madeleine: I liked the dead bird poem (by another classmate). It was a sound poem with bird noises. 
<br>Jacob: I like writing a lot. I like to write stories on my own time 
<p>What did you like the least? 
<br>Madeleine: We spent too much time at the art gallery. 
<br>Kayleen: Going on the bus in the hot sun.</p> 
<p>What did Lyndal Osborne have to say about your work? 
<br>Madeleine: Well, she wrote that she thought if she didn't know it was a kid who wrote it I would have thought it was an adult. 
<br>Raffaella Montemurro: She said she wished her university student wrote that way. </p>
<p>What do you say to people who think art and poetry are only for adults? 
<br>Kayleen: They should change their mind. 
<br>Jacob: Anybody can do poetry if you feel like a poet.</p>
<p>What did you learn from the project? 
<br>Jacob: Well, now I do a lot more writing than I did before. Before, I didn't know I had the talent. What you think is boring can turn out to be fun if it's presented in the right way. 
<br>Alanna: Every time you'd write about something different but it would always have something in common with what you wrote before. 
<br>Jacob: One little thing can expand and expand into a whole different thing. Last year I used to wake up in the morning and write because I was inspired by what I did in this class. </p>
<p>Were you surprised by what came out of the class? 
<br>Montemurro: I'm always surprised in the best way. I think the quality and the sincerity is really quite astounding. </p>
<p>Why use home as the theme? 
<br>It seemed to be something they could all relate to. Home was a concept that was open-ended enough.</p> 
<p>Do you think they enjoyed the project? 
<br>They were thrilled and they got to be so at home at the gallery. And their writing got so much better. </p>

<p><center>Inspired by poem by Lorna Crozier</center></p>

<p><center>You must take the memories of the many golden coloured sunsets 
<br>Or the silver moons over the water 
<br>floating as if dancing. 
<br>These are only two of the many things to take... 
<br>But make sure to leave room for 
<br>all the happiness, sadness and tears.</center> </p>

<p><center> <b>The Wild Wild Woman in the Viney Forest </b>

<p>by Kayleen Schnellback </center></p>

<p><center>The wild wild woman 
<br>in the viney forest, as they say, 
<br>Is she real or is she fake? 
<br>Nobody knows. 
<br>They say she lives in a forest 
<br>or in the sea. 
<br>She comes out in night time, 
<br>when the monkeys swing free. 
<br>I do not want to see her, 
<br>That wild wild woman 
<br>in the viney forest.</center></p> 

<p><b>CREATE YOUR OWN</b></p> 


<p>Here's how you can use things in your own home to make poetry:</p> 

<p>The Collage Poem </p>

<p>- 1. Choose a theme or main idea. 
<br>- 2. Look through a magazine and cut out all the words and phrases that match your theme or idea. 
<br>- 3. Start to arrange them on blank construction paper, choosing a colour you like. 
<br>- 4. Write a poem from the words you cut from the magazine that expresses the idea you have. 
<br>- 5. You might need to search for more verbs or nouns to complete your thoughts. But remember that single words or phrases can be used in a poem. 
<br>- 6. Arrange the poem on paper the way you want it to read and in a way that looks nice. Use your space well. Balance your arrangement. 
<br>- 7. Using a gluestick, neatly glue down your poem to the paper. 
<br>- 8. Use cut-out letters to spell your name at the bottom right-hand corner of the poem.</p> 
<p><center><b>SWEET CELEBRATION IN GLASS; ANNIVERSARY PROJECT CAPTURES STUDENT ARTWORK IN FOUR STAINED-GLASS PANELS</b></center></p>
<p></p>Edmonton Journal 
<br>Fri May 23 2008 
<br>Marta Gold 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">For Virginia Park Elementary School's 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary this year, parents and staff were looking for a project that would involve the school's students and celebrate their achievements.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">They came up with a unique and beautiful idea -- commissioning local stained-glass artist Ted Smith to create four window panels to hang about the school's main entrance. The designs were all inspired by watercolours painted by students at the arts core elementary school. </p>
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">"We just felt that it was really important that the kids were involved. It's their artistic learning that we like to celebrate here," says principal Tami Dowler-Coltman.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">The school's 185 children each created a painting of the season in which they were born. Those pictures were painstakingly reviewed, photocopied, enlarged, cut and pasted by two art teachers -- Kim Yamashita and David Cameron -- into four seasonal designs that Smith used as the basis for his final stained-glass windows.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">"All of their work inspired something. Even just the feel of them is so childlike, and we couldn't have captured that in any other way," adds Dowler-Coltman.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">Smith says he wanted the children's artwork to be a big part of the final product. "I tried to stay very true to the drawings and the colours that they had used," he adds. The four panels he created cover an area about 30 centimetres tall and two metres wide and are made from more than 1,000 pieces of glass. </p>
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">"I was quite thrilled with the designs. One student in the winter one had icicles at the top of the picture and a picket fence -- they had a lot of detail in their drawings and I just thought, for grades 1 to 6, it was impressive the way they had pulled them together."</p> 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">The kids too enjoyed the process, which is documented in photographs hung in the school. It started with Smith holding a stained-glass workshop for the students, to show them how the windows would come together. </p>
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">Dowler-Coltman says Smith put in far more hours on the project than his contract required, amounting to a huge donation of his time and skill. </p>
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">Brennan Halliwell, a Grade 6 student whose painting inspired parts of the summer panel, says he thought it was great to be included in the process. "Instead of them just making it, we had a say in it and we took part in it." Next year, when he leaves Virginia Park, "I'll come and visit and it'll be nice to see them."</p> 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">"It might not be as good as what (Smith) could do," adds Gavin Konrad, another Grade 6 student whose work appears in the spring window. "But it's from people that are from the school so it makes it better and more memorable."</p> 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">Grade 5 student Desirae Pfeffer likes the idea of her artwork being incorporated into the windows. "When I get older, even if my grandchildren or my children go here, I can tell them that my glass is in the school." Her winter scene inspired the icicles, sky and moon in one of the stained-glass panels.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">Lydia Lawrence, who is also in Grade 5, says she was excited to see the trees, leaves, house and cat from her painting in the fall window. "I'm like, 'Sweet, it's going to be there for so long." </p>
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">The school will unveil the windows at its 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary celebration and fine arts night this evening. The event will feature a silent auction, a live auction, a children's festival and a display of students' anniversary projects. The school has been an arts core school specializing in drama, art and music for the past 30 years.</p><hr>
