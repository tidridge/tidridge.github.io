			100 years ago today, on 18 May 1919, Ainslie Burton Tytheridge died in a road accident &ndash; this is his story. He had survived the horrors of World War 1 only to be killed in a tragic accident six months after the war ended.</div>

			<div>&nbsp;</div>

			<div>&nbsp;</div>

			<h3><strong>Family Life</strong></h3>

			<div>&nbsp;</div>

			<div>Ainslie was the son of Henry Burton Holdup Tytheridge and Frances Amelia Langford. They had five children all born in Richmond, Surrey. The children were</div>

			<div>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cecil Walter Langford Tytheridge born 23 July 1875; died 1947 Hove, Sussex age 71</div>

			<div>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arthur Burton Stanbrook Tytheridge born 25 September 1876; died September 1877 age 1</div>

			<div>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twin Arthur George Tytheridge born 5 July 1878; died 18 August 1907 age 29</div>

			<div>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twin Ainslie Burton Tytheridge born 5 July 1878; died 18 May 1919 age 40</div>

			<div>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorothy May Tytheridge born 9 May 1881; died 1960 Chichester, Sussex age 79</div>

			<div>&nbsp;</div>

			<div>Ainslie&#39;s family tree can be found at this&nbsp;<a href="https://titheradgefamilyhistory.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/tree-6a-tytheridge-holdup-feb-2018-for-website.pdf" target="_blank">link</a>.<br />
			<br />
			On the 1881 Census 2-year-old Ainslie was living at 55 Church Road, Richmond with his parents, brother Cecil aged 5, his twin brother Arthur and 3 servants. On the 1891 census 12-year-old Ainslie is living at 343 Goldhawk Road, Hammersmith with his parents, brother Cecil 15, his twin Arthur, sister Dorothy aged 9 and two servants.</div>

			<div>&nbsp;</div>

			<div>The Tytheridge family were wealthy and more information about the wealth of Ainslie&rsquo;s grandfather, William Henry Walter Tytheridge, can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://titheradgefamilyhistory.wordpress.com/the-wealthy-family-members-3/" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ainslie and his twin, Arthur, went to St Paul&rsquo;s School in London, a prestigious public school. While here he spent two years in the school&rsquo;s army cadets. In 1894 he was registered as a Medical Student; with the St Paul&rsquo;s school records showing he went to St Mary&rsquo;s Hospital, London. However, there is no record of him completing his medical studies and becoming a doctor, but throughout his career he was involved with medical professions, being in the army medical corps and in 1914 he gave his occupation as optometrist and medical student.</div>

			<div>&nbsp;</div>

			<h3><strong>Boer War</strong></h3>

			<div>&nbsp;</div>

			<div>On 11 October 1899, the second Boer War broke out and lasted until 31 May 1902. In January 1900 the Imperial Yeomanry was formed, a volunteer mounted force of the British Army. This also included an Imperial Yeomanry Bearer Company responsible for transporting the injured soldiers from the field. The majority of the Company were volunteers from the Medical Staff Corps. Ainslie had been a member of the Corps for 5 years and was among the volunteers. He was given the rank of Sergeant. The company left England on 18 March 1900 and arrived in Cape Town on 7 April 1900. For his war services Ainslie was awarded the Queen&rsquo;s South African Medal with the clasps Cape Colony, Orange Free State, Transvaal. These clasps showed he had been in these areas at some time during the war.<br />
			&nbsp;</div>

			<h3>&nbsp;<strong>Inter War Years</strong></h3>

			<div>&nbsp;</div>

			<div>Ainslie could not have stayed in South Africa long, as on the 1901 census he is recorded as a 22-year-old Medical Student staying at Schmitt&rsquo;s Hotel at 19 Cackes Hill Avenue, Folkestone.</div>

			<div>&nbsp;</div>

			<div>The next record we have found for Ainslie is for his sporting achievements recorded in the local newspapers. He was an extremely talented rower and a member of the Anglian Boat Club which was based near Chiswick / Kew on the River Thames. He won his first race for the club at Marlow in 1903 and went on to be Captain in 1905 and became the first eight coach in 1909.</div>

			<div>&nbsp;</div>

			<div>In August 1907 tragedy struck when Ainslie&rsquo;s twin brother Arthur died. We do not know the cause of death and only know that Arthur worked for the Bank of England and was a member of the Royal Naval Reserve.</div>

			<div>&nbsp;</div>

			<div>In 1910 Ainslie emigrated to Canada. On 2 June 1910 Ainslie sailed from Liverpool on The Tunisian and arrived in Quebec Canada. Nothing further is known about his time in Canada until he enrolled in the Army in 1914. He has not yet been found on the Canadian Census or in any Canadian Records except his enrolment in the Army.</div>

			<div>&nbsp;</div>

			<h3><strong>World War 1</strong></h3>

			<div>&nbsp;</div>

			<div>On 4 August 1914 England declared war on Germany and this meant all the British Empire, including Canada, was at war. Ainslie enlisted for the Canadian Army Medical Corps on 12 September 1914 at Toronto. He gave his address as 12 Charleville Mansions, West Kensington, London which was his father&rsquo;s address. Ainslie&rsquo;s Army Records are now available on line. From these we know that he was of a large build 5 feet 8 inches tall, (although his medical records say 5 feet 10 inches) with a 46-inch chest and an 8inch expansion. On enrolment he weighed 170 pounds (12st 1lb) but his 1918 medical records describe him as 219pounds (15st 6lb) and obese.</div>

			<div>&nbsp;</div>

			<div>He was transferred to the No 1 Canadian Casualty Clearing Station which consisted of 14 Officers and 75 other ranks. Ainslie was employed as Chief Wardmaster. He was promoted to Staff Sergeant in July 1916, to Quartermaster in March 1917 and Sergeant Major in April 1918. The unit arrived in England in October 1914 and went to France in February 1915. It was based initially at Aire, France until January 1916 but it was moved around and was also based at Bailleul, Aubigny, Adinkerke, Zuycoote and Ruitz. A Casualty Clearing Station was a medical facility behind the front line to treat the wounded, but it was located just outside the artillery range of the enemy. They were usually based near transport facilities such as a railway so that the treated soldiers could be evacuated further behind the front line if needed. The 1st Canadian Casualty Clearing Station was busy and in its first two days of arrival saw 550 casualties. Ainslie remained working in the clearing station until he returned to England on leave in January 1918. While in England he was taken ill with stomach problems and spent two periods in hospital. He did not return to the front but worked in England in the Canadian Hospital at Etchinghill Lyminge which was six miles from Folkestone.</div>

			<div>&nbsp;</div>

			<div>After the end of the war in November 1918 Ainslie joined the Freemasons at Temple Lodge in Folkestone.</div>

			<div>&nbsp;</div>

			<h3><strong>Traffic Accident</strong></h3>

			<div>&nbsp;</div>

			<div>Ainslie&#39;s fatal accident is best described by this extract from The Thanet Advertiser and Echo published on 24 May 1919. It is a report on the inquest and tells the story of the tragic events on 18th May 1919.<br />
			<br />
			<strong>Cross- Roads Fatality</strong></div>

			<div>&nbsp;</div>

			<div><br />
			<strong>Canadian Motor Cyclist&#39;s Shocking Death</strong><br />
			&nbsp;</div>

			<div><em>&ldquo;Sergeant Major Ainslie Burton Tytheridge, 39, of the Canadian Army Medical Corps was killed at the Lord of the Manor Cross Roads, near Ramsgate, on Sunday afternoon, while riding a motor cycle. He was coming from the direction of Canterbury and his machine collided with a heavy motor car, which was on its way from Margate to Deal. The result was that Sgt Major Tytheridge was thrown to the side of the road, his skull being smashed, and the front part of his cycle broken off. The car, which belonged to Mr Van der Bergh, of Rowden Hall, Margate, and was in charge of Frederick David Chell, at once pulled up and the chauffeur went into Ramsgate for medical aid. Dr Tamplin went out, and the injured warrant officer was brought into Ramsgate and received at the General Hospital. He was unconscious, and the case was hopeless from the first. Death occurred soon after admission.&rdquo; ..........</em><br />
			<br />
			After reporting the evidence from the witnesses the newspaper article concludes</div>

			<div>&nbsp;</div>

			<div>&nbsp;</div>

			<div><em>&ldquo;The Coroner reviewed the circumstances in detail, and said the jury had not to consider any question of liability for damages, or anything of that kind. The only verdict open to the jury to return was one of accident or one of manslaughter; and in order to justify a verdict of manslaughter it would be necessary to find that the evidence disclosed negligence of a gross, clear and palpable variety. Misjudgement or negligence in a minor degree would not justify the jury in returning that verdict.</em><br />

Soon after that the toll collector left his employment.&nbsp;&nbsp;The toll collector was now dead having died 5 years before the article was written.&nbsp;&nbsp;The widow of this toll collector now lived abroad and was dangerously ill and had now chosen to disclose the fact that it was her husband who had killed Titheridge in a fit of jealousy, &ldquo;having waylaid the unfortunate man, cut his throat and thrust a piece of tile into the wound in order that he might bleed to death.&rdquo;</span></span></div>
