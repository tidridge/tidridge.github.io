						(11225 - 62 street- covers the area of 8 city lots- (.6 ha)- approved February 8, 1984)</b></font></font></center>

						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><img align="left" alt="Highlands Park" height="543" hspace="100" pbzloc="45" src="park27.jpg" vspace="5" width="600" /></font></font>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Highlands Park: Initial investigation seems to indicate that the park was there and needed a name; it was in the Highlands so that was thought to be a suitable name! The secretary of the Park Naming Committee of the city could initially only tell me the park &#39;appeared&#39; February 8, 1984! But more about that later.</font></font></p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Several people in the area have been asked if they know when the park was first on the scene. Clyde Martell remembers playing football on the park in the fifties; the author remembers the park being there when he moved into Highlands proper in 1963.</font></font></p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">The secretary of the Parks Naming Committee was able to say that (remember the park is made up of 8 city lots):<br />
						a. Lots 1-2 Block 12 Plan 3642AJ became city property on February 28, 1923<br />
						b. Lot 4 Block 12 Plan 3642AJ became city property on March 23, 1923<br />
						c. Lot 5 Block 12 Plan 3642AJ became city property on September 25, 1929<br />
						d. Lot 3, Lots 6-8 Block 12 Plan 3642AJ became city property on June 14, 1947.</font></font></p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">It is interesting to note the city assessment maps still shows the lot designations as noted above. So far we cannot tell how the city procured the lots. Metro Chrapko thought may be the lots had been donated: Perhaps it was in conjunction with the construction of the Community Hall in 1948, or the depression, or?</font></font></p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">The City acquired the land for those lots between 1923 and 1947. Three titled lots were acquired in the 1920&#39;s and one in 1947. There are actually four separate titles over five lots but all were purchased by the City between the years indicated. At least for the titled lots purchased in the 1920&#39;s, the price paid for the land was between $400 and $450. They remain as separate lots because the City has not yet moved to consolidate the property.</font></font></p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">In trying to discover more information about the naming of the park the author casually mentioned it at a meeting of the Highland Place Seniors&#39; Home committee. From a &#39;confidential but reliable source&#39;... in 1984 there was a move to have the park named after an ethnic dance group... this encouraged (?) people to have the park called Highlands... and the mystery deepens!!</font></font></p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">The &#39;great discovery&#39; was shared with Cory Sousa, Planner, City of Edmonton, she provided the following... (Darrell Nordell, our own community coordinator has also been very much involved).</font></font></p>

						<p><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Hi John,<i> (informal because we &#39;chatted&#39; back and forth... considerably!)</i></font></font></p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">I looked at the original minutes but there wasn&#39;t much detail. However, I do know that a particular dance group was looking at potential sites/parks to have named in their honour in and around the Highlands Neighbourhood in the past. While it&#39;s possible that this pushed the community to name their park &#39;Highlands&#39;, it wouldn&#39;t have been anything against any group, individual, or association. It&#39;s actually Parks Branch practice and stated in our Naming Policy to name the major park in a community after the Neighbourhood name. Therefore, one can assume that the community league pursued the naming of that park site to &#39;Highlands Parks&#39; to have at least one park in their community reflecting their name and location, hence honouring the &#39;Highlands&#39; heritage, regardless of who made an earlier application to name the park.</font></font></p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">There is also some context that needs to be recognized during the early 1980&#39;s. The City of Edmonton went through a major Neighbourhood and Community boundary clean-up during this time. During annexation in 1982, there was a greater realization that many civic departments, community leagues, and agencies used different boundaries to identify communities. It was then directed by City Council to clean-up these issues and establish very defined boundaries for the neighbourhoods in which ALL Civic Departments, Community Leagues, and Agencies (ie. EdTel, Edmonton Power, etc.) would use.</font></font></p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">This process eliminated smaller communities and their associated names. For example, what used to be known as two separate neighbourhoods &#39;Santa Rosa&#39; and &#39;Montrose&#39;, were combined to form &#39;Montrose.&#39; Many long term residents of &#39;Santa Rosa&#39; were upset about this, but as a compromise, the park that resided in their area was officially called &#39;Santa Rosa Park&#39; to reinforce the previous history of the &#39;Santa Rosa&#39; community/subdivision.</font></font></p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">This process had to be done as there were many tiny subdivisions with their own unique names but the Administration needed consistency as Edmonton continued to grow.</font></font></p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Therefore, one can assume that the residents of &#39;Highlands&#39; (going through this neighbourhood clean up process too, as all communities did in the early 80&#39;s) also didn&#39;t want to lose their identity and acted quickly to name a park after their neighbourhood. No offence to any ethic dance group, individual, etc. but it was something the community most likely would have done eventually.</font></font></p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">I hope this all makes sense and helps solve the mystery to some degree.</font></font></p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">The tree make-up is similar to that of the other parks with poplars and firs in the majority. The park has a modern set of children&#39;s playthings, a wading pool, and facilities for the summer programs that are sponsored by the community and run by the city. </font></font></p>
