			<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Ed was born and brought up at Orari Station, and worked on the farm. He probably knew Belle for most of his life, as her parents also lived in the area. When she was 16, Ed gave her a small crystal jug,which Maisie still has. </font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">After they married they saved to buy a small farm. Their first child was stillborn, but that tragedy was followed by the births of two healthy boys in 1900 and 1902. </font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Shortly afterwards Belle contracted peritonitis, which in those days was usually fatal. She recovered, but had a bad breakdown due to all the poison in her system. The Doctor insisted she go away from the farm for her health, and also forbade her to have any more children for at least ten years, as she would never survive. </font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Not long before, Belle had received a letter from a cousin of hers who had recently emigrated to Australia. She had been thrilled to find a relation so close, as since both her parents had emigrated on their own, she had no relatives on this side of the world at all.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Ed sold the farm, arranged for relatives to mind the boys, and took Belle to Aus for several months, coming back in much better health.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Their next home was at Woodbury, where Ed did contract carrying with a team of six horses, while Belle sewed, and they saved for another farm.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Ed had an excellent singing voice, and neighbours could hear him far down the road, singing in the early morning as he carted his bales of wool.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">While he was away on longer trips, Belle would pull dead wood from the hedges and put the sticks in piles for him to collect on his way home for firewood.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">About 1910 the large Tripp Station at Orari was broken up into smaller runs, and the Titheridges managed to successfully ballot for one of these. It was only an empty section when they arrived, but Ed built a house, and planted trees all around, many of which are still there.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">During this time, Les spent several weeks of term at home with a broken leg.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">In 1913 Sheila arrived, and four years later the family was made complete with the birth of Maisie. Shortly after this they had to leave. Due to the war there was no help available, and Ed had ruptured a kidney trying to lift a large strainer post on his own. He was no longer able to manage the work after this, which must have been a hard blow for him. If they had been able to hang on a little longer, they would have made at least double the profit, as land prices soared after the war, however Belle was always pleased they did not,as two of her brothers had fought overseas, and she had no wish to make money out of the conflict.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">From here the family shifted to Timaru, where the boys attended Timaru Boys High School. Ed became a real estate property valuer, and the they lived in two different houses during this time.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">The next change was to Christchurch, partly because Les was about to enter Canterbury University, and partly because the constant stream of visitors from Geraldine who found the large house at Timaru a convenient stopping point were wearing Belle out.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">As she was ill at the time they shifted, Ed was sent ahead to find a house, with instructions that it had to be of a decent size. He came back saying the rooms were at least as big as the current sun-room, but when they arrived he was found to have judged very poorly, as the house was tiny. It was on the corner of Hills Rd and Aylesford St. The house is still there, but the lovely long lawn that sloped down to the river has fallen a victim to sub-division. </font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Once Les followed them up, about 1923,space became too tight, and it was time to shift again, to 48 Warrington St. This was a bigger house, with wide shallow steps leading up to a large verandah. Again, the house is still there, but has been modified.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">At the time they were going to shift from this address, they and some friends got together to buy three sections, each couple would have one and a half to build their own place, but the friends changed their minds, so all three had to be sold.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Living in Christchurch did nothing for Belle&#39;s persistent throat problems, so the next stop was Kowhai Bush (on the way to the West Coast), for about three years.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">By 1929 Alec was married with three children, and Les was a teacher in Auckland with a new wife and baby. While Sheila and Maisie boarded (Sheila in town, Maisie at Springfield), Ed and Belle went up to meet the new grandchild. They stayed for a while, and were finally persuaded to send for the girls and live in Auckland for a time. A flat was found in a large house in Kowhai St, Takapuna right by the lake. The Warrington St house was rented out, and they lived in Auckland for another three years. Sheila would have been sixteen, and Maisie twelve at the time, the latter finishing her primary schooling at Takapuna Primary, then having two and a half years at Takapuna Grammar. In 1932 they returned to Christchurch, midway through her School Cert year. Although Belle and Sheila both wanted to stay in Auckland, the tenants had left their house in Christchurch, and Ed felt it was time to go home.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">During this spell in Christchurch Belle&#39;s parents came to live with them, as Sandy was in his 90&#39;s and an invalid, and Agnes, although ten years younger, was unable to cope. Maisie finished school, did her kindergarten training, then studied at home for her training college entrance exam while she recovered from a crook ankle, and helped her mother, who was having more throat problems, with her grandfather. </font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">At one stage, Ed went to Auckland to visit the family, and during this time Belle came down with a lethal virus. Two of the three people in Christchurch who caught it died. Maisie had to paint her mothers throat every hour, which must have been terribly hard on both of them through the long nights. However, Belle pulled through, perhaps she had built up an immunity during her previous illnesses. One of the worst parts was that while in Auckland Ed had contracted a skin disease, and ended up in Auckland Hospital, so he was unable to come home and help.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Sandy died aged 98 in 1937, and Agnes left to live with a daughter in Geraldine for her remaining years.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">In 1939 another section had been purchased, and a builder hired. During the time the house was going up, Ed was away, and Belle was at Hanmer Springs Hospital with (?)neuritis(?), so Maisie was deputized to check on progress each night. She found the builder very obstreperous, and inclined to do things his way. She had great difficulty making him stay with what had been decided on. Then war broke out, and although most builders finished whatever they were working on before heading for Burnham Camp, this particular specimen said he was leaving immediately. He offered to pay back all the money that Ed had spent, and take over the property. This was agreed to, then funnily enough the house was completed within a couple of weeks!</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Unfortunately the Warrington St house had already been sold, so the boxes were packed again (Belle must have had packing down to a fine art by now), and it was off to Oxford, just off Birdhill Rd, where Alec had three farms, each with a house, and needed some help. His parents lived first at Glendair, then Mayfield, where Ed did some extensive improvements to the accommodation. Sheila and Karl, who had married in 1940 were living nearby, but as they had no hot water, they used to have a bath whenever they visited. </font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Ed worked on the farm helping Alec till he died. He had been experiencing bad pain, but omitted to tell the doctor that he was spitting blood, once that was discovered it was not long before cancer was diagnosed and he was sent to Christchurch Hospital. Les hurried down from Auckland, and Alec had driven in with a car for Maisie to use, so the whole family were there when he died.</font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Belle and Maisie stayed on at Oxford until Alec sold the farms and bought a garage. Sheila and Karl had also shifted to Awateri, so mother and daughter went back to Christchurch and found a flat in Fendalton for a short while, then lived in Alec&#39;s flat in Gracefield after he went to the garage, it was a very cold place, in the shadow of the hospital) before ending up in Mays Rd, Papanui.
