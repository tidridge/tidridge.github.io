			<blockquote>
			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">The name TITHERADGE can be traced to the ancient Celtic culture of Wales. Initially the name was from the personal name Tudor, which is the Welsh form of Theodore. The surname TITHERADGE is one of the oldest Welsh names. The lands of Britain have been inhabited by many different ethnic groups, perhaps the oldest of which is the race which hails from the snow-capped mountains and peaceful valleys of Wales.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">After the exodus of the Romans in the 5<sup>th</sup> century A.D., the ancient Britons were left in possession of Western England, present day Wales and Cumbria, while the Germanic invaders, the Saxons, Jutes and Angles continued a determined invasion from the South-East of England. The first recorded King of Wales was Rhodri Mawr, or Roderick the Great. He died in 893, bequeathing Wales to his three sons, Anarawd, who became the King of North Wales, Cadalh, who became King of South Wales and Mervyn, who became King of Powys, or mid Wales.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">The history of the name TITHERADGE begins in the time of the ancient Welsh chronicles, in which the first record of the name TITHERADGE was found in Herefordshire where Tudor Trevor was Lord of Hereford, Whittington, and both Maelors. He was founder of the Tribe of the Marches, born in Denbigh, son of Ynyr Ap Cadforch, whose descendants inter-married with the distinguished families of North Wales.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Researchers examined early manuscripts such as the Domesday Book, the Pipe Rolls, Hearth Rolls, the Black Book of the Exchequer, the Curia Regis Rolls, and the TITHERADGE family name was found, but with many different spellings. Variations in the spelling of TITHERADGE include Tudor, Tudyr, Tuder, Tudar and many of these are still in use today. Changes in spelling could occur between father and son, and it was not impossible for a person to be born with one spelling, marry with another, and have yet another on his or her headstone. Preference for a particular spelling variation could signify a connection with a certain branch of the family, a religious adherence, or an affiliation with a political party or cause. On the other hand, variations could also occur due to regional dialects, translations back and forth between languages, and the way that the clerks and church officials of the day chose to record the spelling of a name.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Edward I conquered Wales in the 13<sup>th</sup> century, and proved to be an onerous overlord over Wales. Spirited, yet unsuccessful revolts, were waged by Llywelyn and his younger brother David, but Wales was to exist under an alien political system, playing a subordinate role in the kingdom of England. A great number of impressive fortresses were then erected by Edward throughout Wales to eliminate any possibility of further revolt. In 1301, King Edward made his son, Lord Edward (who had been born at Caemarfon Castle), Prince of Wales and Count of Chester, and ever since that date, these titles have been automatically conferred upon the first-born son of the English monarch.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">By the 15<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> centuries, England, ravaged by plagues and famines lost as much as 70% of their working population of peasants. The Welsh, attracted by the economic opportunities, moved eastward into the English cities. Seemingly not affected by the plagues they multiplied amongst the sparse population of England.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">In this era, bearers of the family name TITHERADGE were located in Hereford where the descendants of Tudor, the Earls of Richmond merged into the Crown of England in 1485 through Sir Owen Tudor when he married the Queen Dowager of England, widow of King Henry V. Descended were the Dukes of Bedford,Somerset, and Lancaster, and the Prince of Wales, eldest son of Henry VII, and afterwards the Duke of York who would become Henry VIII. Meanwhile junior lines abounded in North Wales at various locations, using cither the name Tudor or Trevor. Notable amongst the family during the late Middle Ages was Sir Owen Tudor.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">For the next two or three centuries the surname TITHERADGE flourished and played an important role in local politics and in the affairs of Britain in general.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Throughout the 16<sup>th</sup>, 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> centuries, Britain was ravaged by religious conflict Henry the VIII started the great schism between the Roman Church and the English state. The power of the Church, and the Crown, their assessments, tithes, and demands on rich and poor alike broke the spirit of men and many turned from religion entirety, or renewed their faith, pursuing with a vigor and ferocity, the letter of the ecclesiastical law.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Difficult times at home, and opportunity abroad encouraged the emigration of many Welsh. Some went to Ireland where they were known as the Adventurers for land. Essentially, they contracted to maintain and develop the Protestant faith, being granted lands previously owned by the Catholic Irish. The name TITHERADGE may well have arrived in Ireland following the 13<sup>th</sup> century invasion with the &quot; Welshmen of Hy-Amhalgaidh MicFiachrach,&quot; who settled in Ireland. Most of these names were transformed in Irish Gaelic names. Others of Welsh heritage were among those who came to Ireland in successive waves of immigration from the 13<sup>th</sup> to the 17<sup>th</sup> centuries.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">The New World beckoned the adventurous. Some of the Welsh emigrants sailed from Ireland, but most sailed directly from Wales or England. Others moved to the European continent. They sailed to the New World across the stormy Atlantic aboard the tiny sailing ships which were to become known as the &quot;White Sails.&quot; These overcrowded ships, designed for 100 but frequently crammed with 400 and 500 passengers, spent two months at sea, were wracked with disease, sometimes landing with only 60 to 70 of the original passenger list. </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">In North America, early immigrants bearing the TITHERADGE family name or a spelling variation of the name, were Richard Tudor and his wife Mary, two children and servants, settled in the Barbados in 1678; Lewis Tudor (*Titheradge) settled in New England in 1654; Robert Tudor (*Tither) settled in Virginia in 1773. </font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Many of the earliest settlers to Australia were convicts, transported from Britain to live and work in the penal colonies. Throughout the 19<sup>th</sup> century, North America was the primary destination for migrants from Europe. Many also came to Australia, as they were offered incentives and financial assistance.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Notable bearers of this name from recent history include James Tudor, High Commissioner for the Barbados; Sir Haydn Tudor-Evan, Judge of the High Court; David Tudor-Price, Crown Attorney.</font></p>

A Crest is only awarded to a noble family by the Royal family for outstanding services. This is confirmed further with the high honour of being able to display a Black Crown on the head of the Lion. The colour black is used to denote constancy and/or misery. In this instance, given the success awarded to the family, black would denote constancy of service to the Welsh Royals.</font></p>

John does not have a particularly strong bent for curiosity, even though an ex-policeman. He has been encouraged, however, that all the Titheridge family with all its various spellings have come from illustrious backgrounds. He carries a small containers holding a saline substance for use on these occasions. That is not to say that we as a family have not contributed in significant ways to the western world. The family has, as a whole, seems to have trumpeters employed for announcements, the family being modest by nature! </font></p>
