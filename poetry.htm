<p>Over the years John Tidridge has written all sorts of stories and poetry. It is for you to judge the quality. He found it a great pressure release. <hr>

<p><center>Old Age</center></p>
<p><center>(Written on October 2007 as I watched my friend Bruce McLean get out of my car and head to Shopper's Drugs)</center></p>

<p><center>Old Age! What a bummer!
<br>Just like the last days of summer.
<br>Aching back, wonky knees,
<br>Slightest chill  and we start to sneeze.
<br>Walking is a continuing pain. 
<br>And what for? There is no gain.</center></p>

<p><center>Accept it? To give in would be a sin!
<br>We must face aging with a grin!
<br>Young people would just laugh and say,
<br>Ah, but they've had their day.
<br>But us older ones know it's not true
<br>And really, to give us our due,
<br>Our spirits are great, still in their prime,
<br>We just know it's not the time
<br>To concede to age!</center></p><hr>

<p><center><b>OCEAN</b></center></p>

<p><center>What is this power that draws me to your shores?
<br>Time and again I must come back for more.
<br>Today you are a sea of sparkling diamonds,
<br>As the sun shines down upon your gentle vista.
<br>Change comes, the overcast sky causes you to look foreboding,
<br>Your colour turning a dark and murky slate gray.
<br>Huge waves whipped by the wind come crashing to the shore,
<br>I do not venture close to you today.
<br>Again change comes, children playing in your gently lapping waves, 
<br>Carrying pails of you to build sandcastles on the shore.
<br>What is this power that draws me to your shores?
<br>The Creator' Hand that brings me back for more.</center></p><hr>

<p><center>January 29, 2012 Written to my good friend Ellard... who leads the Monday Night Mens' Group</center></p>

<p><center>
Through the gates I did go
<br>Where they led me I don't know</center></p>
<p><center>Tales of work in days of yore
<br>Will never ever be a bore...</center></p>
<p><center>Sometimes it hard to follow,
<br>Don't treat my remarks as being hollow...</center></p>
<p><center>On Monday next 'twill l be my delight
<br>To see what Ellard brings this night...</center></p>
<p><center>Written as you will guess to my brother and sister who seemed to owe me a letter!</center></p>
<p><center>Yo Sibs:</center></p>
<p><center>At -30C I sit and wait
<br>For a note, I guess it's late?
<br>So Bro, and Sis, get up and write,
<br>Surely it's not the dead of night?</center></p>
<p><center>Love John</center></p> 
<p><center>Results satisfactory!</center></p>
