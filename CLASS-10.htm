To continue in this unestablished view: the standard &#39;order of dress&#39; for the class (male) would have been, &#39;shirt (probably white), tie, sports jacket and flannels&#39;, black or brown brogues, with haircuts of the &#39;short back and sides&#39; variety. The author&#39;s unbiased view was, the class was of responsible, hardworking men and women blessed with commonsense and quite capable of carrying out the tasks ahead of them.</span></span></p>

And, back again the next day for the same thing! Some found it harder than others, some were just out of school others had forgotten what school was all about! It was no picnic, work was a necessity , the instructors were good but you had to pay attention.</span></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif">Drill was first thing every morning. You were assigned a place in the squad determined by height and that was your place! Drill was good, Sergeant Major Ward was a good instructor. Rex Moore was our right hand man! The physical training and running were hard to start with, but as our bodies adjusted the easier it became.... or so we were led to believe. Self-defence was interesting... little did we know that we would use it infrequently and when needed, it had been forgotten. Must of us learned to talk our way out of jams. Our gym sessions were brightened up by very competitive games of volley ball...what was lacked in skill was made up for with enthusiasm.</span></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif">The department tried to intersperse the lessons with visits to different locations for example the Fort Saskatchewan Gaol, the U of A hospital to watch an autopsy etc.</span></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif">A sense of camaraderie soon developed, fellow sufferers pitted against the powers that be. Not that we were treated badly; far from it.... but if you have served in the military at all you will get the drift.</span></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif">The time flew by, all the necessary exams had been passed, drill and physical training had reached superb levels we were ready to graduate...

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif">Tidridge determined that if he had to use the revolver he would throw it rather than fire it. Some men were allowed to fire an ancient tommy gun and sten gun. Just in passing, all of the &#39;assault weapons&#39; possessed by the department were housed in a closet, down town, there were a couple of the previously noted tommy and sten guns, some tear gas and perhaps one or two body vests; the department, in 2009, is in possession of incredible the fire power. How times have changed. And, with Sergeant Major Ward,<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Foot Drill.</b></span></p>

Sam also made sergeant. John Tidridge says this particular area of the Police Department (history) has been so badly neglected they could not tell him the name of the Deputy Chief for 1959!</span></p>

Rod taught<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Physical Fitness.</b><span>&nbsp;</span>Again, the military influence was obvious, The drills were identical to those used in the British army. The only exception was the warming-up run which consisted of an ever increasing number of circuits around the police gymnasium. Much later classes took to the outdoors and ran in the river valley and, up and down an horrendous amount of stairs! Macdonald, was a one time Canadian Army boxing champion who later fought for a world title. Unsuccessfully, unfortunately.</span></p>
