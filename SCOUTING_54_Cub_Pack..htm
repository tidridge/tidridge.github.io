			<h3><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="green"><font color="#0000ff">There are two reasons for these notes... it is time to downsize and to have some record for the children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren,with a little of the history of John Tidridge </font></font></font></h3>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="green"><font color="#0000ff"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">In 1961 John T was half listening to a conversation between his wife and her friend. He nodded at what he thought were the appropriate places. It turned out he was volunteering to lead the 54<sup>th</sup> Wolf Cub Pack of the Highlands Baptist Church.</font></font></font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="green"><font color="#0000ff"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Thus began 10 years of mostly fun. It brought back memories of his days at St, Mary&#39;s Church, Eling, Hants, UK. where Captain Wardle, Church Army, was the Cub Master. John remembers only being sent home for some misdemeanor!</font></font></font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="green"><font color="#0000ff"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Attending the first meeting John soon discovered that the then leader wanted out and quickly... he must have noted John&#39;s obvious skills with the lads... he left shortly thereafter.<img align="right" alt="Training Camp for Leaders" height="237" hspace="10" src="scout02.jpg" vspace="10" width="300" /></font></font></font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="green"><font color="#0000ff"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">It is fair to say John took full interest in his job, getting all the training he could. He succeeded in earning his Wood Badge which was quite an onerous chore. It meant a week at camp, plus some written material as well. But it was well worth it, learning all the skills a leader needed.</font></font></font></font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="green"><font color="#0000ff"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">At that time the program was the same world wide. It consisted of the cubs learning different skills and finally earning two stars. There simply was not much choice of topic...which at the time John Tidridge thought was OK. In the early sixties a new program developed that gave the boys far more choice and his opinion the easier ones were chosen over the harder tasks. By now he had served ten years and it was time to leave. <img align="left" alt="John T in full regalia" height="152" hspace="10" src="scout03.jpg" vspace="10" width="100" /> </font></font></font></font></font></p>

These camps were conducted along military lines and were a great success. It required a great deal of help from parents who were the cooks, nurses and general camp moms. There were two memorable occasions... during the 1965 camp John became a father... and no one showed up with vehicles to take the boys home... it took a world record of cramming boys into two vehicles to get home! It was accomplished.</font></font></font></font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="green"><font color="#0000ff"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Two other incidents stand out...remember there were three cub packs at the same camp, well separated from each other. One camp signalled all their activities by the use of trumpet blowing. The other pack&#39;s senior leader sported a coolie hat which he greatly treasured. We thought it would be a good source of food if we could borrow both items... we succeeded... the trumpet was returned for a plate of cookies.. which we found had been doctored with salt. The other group exacted their &#39;revenge&#39; at the campfire... our leaders were encouraged to be part of a performance... some how or other we found our faces were daubed with I think grease of some sort... all in good fun! </font></font></font></font></font></p>
