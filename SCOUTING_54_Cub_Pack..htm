He nodded at what he thought were the appropriate places. It turned out he was volunteering to lead the 54<sup>th</sup> Wolf Cub Pack of the Highlands Baptist Church.</font></font></font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="green"><font color="#0000ff"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Thus began 10 years of mostly fun. It brought back memories of his days at St, Mary&#39;s Church, Eling, Hants, UK. where Captain Wardle, Church Army, was the Cub Master. John remembers only being sent home for some misdemeanor!</font></font></font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="green"><font color="#0000ff"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Attending the first meeting John soon discovered that the then leader wanted out and quickly... he must have noted John&#39;s obvious skills with the lads... he left shortly thereafter.<img align="right" alt="Training Camp for Leaders" height="237" hspace="10" src="scout02.jpg" vspace="10" width="300" /></font></font></font></font></p>

He succeeded in earning his Wood Badge which was quite an onerous chore. It meant a week at camp, plus some written material as well. But it was well worth it, learning all the skills a leader needed.</font></font></font></font></font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="green"><font color="#0000ff"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">At that time the program was the same world wide. It consisted of the cubs learning different skills and finally earning two stars. There simply was not much choice of topic...which at the time John Tidridge thought was OK. In the early sixties a new program developed that gave the boys far more choice and his opinion the easier ones were chosen over the harder tasks. By now he had served ten years and it was time to leave. <img align="left" alt="John T in full regalia" height="152" hspace="10" src="scout03.jpg" vspace="10" width="100" /> </font></font></font></font></font></p>

These camps were conducted along military lines and were a great success. It required a great deal of help from parents who were the cooks, nurses and general camp moms. There were two memorable occasions... during the 1965 camp John became a father... and no one showed up with vehicles to take the boys home... it took a world record of cramming boys into two vehicles to get home! It was accomplished.</font></font></font></font></font></p>

One camp signalled all their activities by the use of trumpet blowing. The other pack&#39;s senior leader sported a coolie hat which he greatly treasured. We thought it would be a good source of food if we could borrow both items... we succeeded... the trumpet was returned for a plate of cookies.. which we found had been doctored with salt. The other group exacted their &#39;revenge&#39; at the campfire... our leaders were encouraged to be part of a performance... some how or other we found our faces were daubed with I think grease of some sort... all in good fun! </font></font></font></font></font></p>

			Greetings Little Brothers! It is now some time since you received the last verbal cuff from the Paw of Baloo. It was just the other day that I was speaking to Akela about how well &quot;Our Cubs&quot; responded to The Old Wolves instruction. You must admit that you were all a rather stickey, spindly lot when you arrived at Sylvan Lake, and it was with pride that Your Old Wolves watched the sleek bunch move off to their distant Lairs at the end of the weeks course. You had learned the Law of the Jungle well and it was with confidence that you left to resume once again, charge of your own Packs. </span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">My greatest wish is that you use whatever knowledge you obtained on your Part ll Woodbadge Course for the benefit of &quot;The Boy&quot;. Never forget that it is &quot;he&quot; that you are serving. Train him well, Little Brothers, and you will have achieved your Aim..</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Good Hunting to you, one and all,<br />
			BALOO,<br />
			Ron Hardy.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">RAKSHA&#39;S MESSAGE<br />
			Hear ye! Hear ye} All you of the Jungle. Raksha is on the prowl. What is she after now? Is it bugs or beetles? Is it those Handicrafts, S.T.A.&#39;s? Is it a camel? No, no, no. I think it&#39;s for the Body in the Bag this time.</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Wasn&#39;t it fun though, and you were all such jolly good Cubs, Please accept my sincere thanks for the privilege of being a part-of, the Gilwell Camp of &#39;63. I just hope that if I ever go again, there will be one more Brown Six around.&nbsp;</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">I can&#39;t help but marvel at the wonderful spirit of Scouting so evident at this course. Monday, when we all finally found Camp Woods and Gilwell lodge, we were strangers. By Tuesday, we were all friends. Must have been that delicious cup of tea, the Scouts prepared for us To the Cubs on course, I would like to say that I trust you got as much out of the Course as you put into it. Your enthusiasm and your interest made it a pleasure to be on Staff.</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">I would also like to say a word of appreciation to the other members on Staff, A more congenial group, I have never worked with, I&#39;m sure. Thanks for having me.....even the kicks I received are nearly forgotten. Congratulations Akela, on a wonderful job well done.</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Good Cubbing to you all, and to Simonne, I would add &quot;Good Hunting&quot;.<br />

I don&#39;t know whether you realize it or not, but this particular circle here is a very dear one to me because of all the experiences that I have had here on various courses. I have always looked forward to being among you when you are here taking part in this wonderful experience of Gilwell,</font></span></p>

			<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I sincerely hope that, and I would judge from the way you are entering into the campfire, that you are getting something from this Gilwell training which is over and above the regular program. By this I mean, the real Gilwell spirit... because when B.P. instigated Gilwell, this is what he wanted the candidates to have... the real spirit of Scouting and Cubbing. If you go home with that, it matters&#39; not what else you may have learned here because if you have the real spirit, I think that you can overcome just about any obstacle that there is in this movement of ours.</font></span></p>

			<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I don&#39;t think that I have to say anything to you about responsibilities as Leaders because you are all aware, as I am, and all the rest of us who are in this game, just how the Scout Movement is growing in the Province of Alberta. It is just growing by leaps and bounds. For one who gets around as I do and sees the enormous amounts of boys that are still trying to get into our Cub Packs and Scout Troops, it&#39;s a tremendous challenge. Therefore, it&#39;s people like you, who when you go back will really have to carry the cross and help those other Leaders who ha ve not had training, to get it, to follow in your footsteps here to Gilwell in order that they can do a real good job for us also.</font></span></p>

I know those who are on the team very well and I&#39;m sure, that they have given you some real experiences. These are all dedicated people who are working on the training team and believe me, they themselves&#39; know how difficult it is at times to meet the mark. But if you enter into this program the way you should, and the way I see you are doing, I&#39;m quite sure that you are going to go home and we are going to consider you some of the most successful candidates of Gilwell that we have had.</font></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">There is a lot of fun ahead of you if you&#39;ll play the game with the Cubs. Be a Leader who pulls - not one who pushes, Help these boys make the best of their Cub years.<br />
			Remember that you are still a Boy Scout - a better Scout because you are a Leader helping boys to become good Cubs and eventually, become good Boy Scouts. Younger boys will imitate you -- follow you. Set them a good example. Above all, be not only their Leader - but their friend,</span></p>

			,<br />
			Gilwell 1963 was a most joyous experience. It was truly an original experience...&quot;young&quot; Akela, &quot;yodelling&quot; Baloo, &quot;wise&quot; Kaa, &quot;smiling&quot; Bagheera, &quot;blackened&quot; Raksha, the Bander-log, Slip and Slop, the Pack with an occasional red devil and flipper thrown in.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">This reminds me of a story &quot;Once upon a time, a cook boiled a number of prunes. The prunes were bad so she had to throw them out. A crow, who was sitting on the pump handle, flew over to the garbage heap, picked up a prune, flew back to the pump handle and ate it, He flew off the pump handle, got another prune, flew back to the pump handle and ate it. He continued until all the prunes were gone., He fell off the pump handle - dead.&quot; </span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Moral to the story -- Don&#39;t fly off the handle when you are full of prunes.</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Keep up Good Scouting with plenty of fun and games.</span><br />

			<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">On Monday, the 22nd of July, The Gilwell Training Ground was over-shadowed by an early morning overcast. No sign of activity until almost eight-thirty. The hounds, Slip and Slop, had slept in, being exhausted after a strenuous night of &quot;Snipe Hunting&quot;.</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">After a late breakfast, Akela and Co., busied themselves getting ready for the incoming course. When it came to raising the new flag pole, Kaa and White Hood had disappeared on one of their many mysterious trips into town.</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">ame the time for commencing the Course, tensions grew and at 1:30 P.M. --- HORRORS --- only one cub present and even he disappeared after finding out where the parking lot was. Soon they began to arrive - popping up from all directions. </span></p>

			<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">We ended up with 19 Cubs. These were:<br />
			Great Cubs, Small Cubs, Brawny Cubs, Black Cubs, White Cubs, Yellow Cubs, Grey Cubs, Grave Old Plodders, And Gay Young Friskers.</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">It must have been the exotic odor of White Hood&#39;s tea served on the lawn according to true Gilwell traditions. They came 300 odd miles from Athabasca in the North and 3 quarts of oil and 4 gallons of gas from Lethbridge in the South.</span><br />

			&nbsp;</p>

			<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">After a successful campfire with entertainment provided by the Staff, &quot;mug up&quot; was held at the Gilwell Lodge with George and Pierre (Slip and Slop) doing the pouring. The &quot;Cubs&quot; from the &quot;tropic zone&quot; found it extremely cold and necessary to use their prized possession &quot;The Hot Water Bottle&quot;. Upon retiring, some of the feminine members decided to warm up by doing the &quot;Twist&quot;. We don&#39;t know what the masculine members did -- but from our camp, they sounded like a bunch of party poopers.</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">After a very short night, the day started as early as 5:00 A.M. for some Cubs and as late as 6:00 A.M. for others. The camp ground was a beehive of activity - what with the building of alter campfires, starting-breakfast and heating &quot;bathwater&quot; for the more cowardly Cubs. At nine sharp, the bell tolled to let all &quot;well fed&quot; Cubs know it was time for Flag Break. What-holl! Disaster struck our camp -- the flag was hanging upside down and Akela doesn&#39;t miss a thing. However, after Kaa came to the rescue, the program was underway again. We played a few strenuous games before the Old Wolves saw fit to let us have the results on our Lairs. Baloo wasn&#39;t kidding when he said he&#39;d crack the whip as all pennants were flying very low - about a foot in the ground to be exact, after his daily inspection.</span></p>

			<p><br />
			<span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The afternoon sessions went well until White Hood was put in charge. Never mind, White Hood, the scenery was beautiful, even if it was the wrong trail. The day wasn&#39;t all bad as we all enjoyed the session of &quot;relaxation&quot; while Kaa and Akela proved that it was possible for only two people to put up a wall tent. Thanks Kaa - we&#39;d like more of this sort of thing:</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">We&#39;re also&#39;grateful to Raksha -- who knows -- if she hadn&#39;t jumped up and down and shouted, we may never have seen a white rabbit. As for Bagheera (the silent but dangerous type) we feel he should receive a medal of some sort as he was the only one publicly brave enough to try &quot;Cub Coffee&quot;.</span><br />

			&nbsp;</p>

			<p pbzloc="4" style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="7" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">&quot;Mug Up&quot; at Gilwell Lodge had an international flavour -- songs from Germany, Denmark and a &quot;dirge&quot; called &quot;Ikely Moor B&#39;Tat&quot; -- This is alleged to be the &quot;National Anthem&quot; of the Uncivilized Natives who live North of London, London, England, that is Baloo appears to have &quot;the most frightfully&quot; English accent of the attending &quot;kippers&quot;.</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p pbzloc="4" style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="8" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The &quot;weaker&quot; sex then retired -- and apparently although exhausted, spent the &quot;once again short night&quot;, doing battle with mice.</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p pbzloc="4" style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="9" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Dawn broke -- this time in a solo effort by &quot;Abe&quot; -- no relation to the late lamented president -- joined later by other &quot;tardier&quot; males. The &quot;weaker&quot; Cubs just made it by breakfast time. Flag break was nearly conducted by a &quot;MacAkela&quot;.</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p pbzloc="4" style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="10" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Baloo returned from his daily tour of inspection, looking slightly pooped -- this caused by him having to raise each pennant a &quot;mighty 3 inches. </span></p>

			<p pbzloc="4" style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="11" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Raksha bearing gifts of money and tobacco - left presumably as bribei, returned to the Parade square where she very kindly distributed her gifts among the Old - Old Wolves.</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p pbzloc="4" style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="12" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Cubs retired for &quot;fairy tales&quot; from Bagheera where we learned of St, George who chased a dragon with a thistle - causing the dragon to step upon a snake whereupon it - the dragon - changed into a fish - and the fish swam away to a lake called &quot;Sylvan&quot;,</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p pbzloc="4" style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="13" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The Cubs re-gathered to be inspected by &quot;Baloo&quot; - who showed great interest in the &quot;gleaming - shining fur&quot; of one of the young Cubs, White Hood having finished inspecting the &quot;fangs&quot; of the Cubs, handed them back to their respective owners:11 Kaa inspected &quot;claws&quot; -- it was rumored the Old Wolves were short of sausages.</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p pbzloc="4" style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="14" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Sometime during the morning the Cubs were &quot;herded&quot; by White Hood into a Stampede. As a new item) we include here the fact that the village of Calgary was named after one particularly bad stampede.</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p pbzloc="4" style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="15" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">It was noted at lunchtime, the Old Wolves visited each &quot;grub site&quot;) all with hungry looking faces -- what have &quot;Slip and Slop&quot; been feeding the Old Wolves</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p pbzloc="4" style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="16" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">First blood letting of note occurred when a young Cub tried to grub out a tree trunk with her little right toe -- Baloo sent for an adult and first aid was rendered.</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p pbzloc="4" style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="17" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Raksha instructed the Cubs on handicrafts and after the talk, one Cub was noted trying to set several square and clay-like wolves into a Round Parade Circle.</span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="18" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">THIRD BEATS&nbsp; -- Continued (Who said women were long winded?) </span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="21" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Afternoon sessions ended with an overcast sky - chilly wind - and the threat of rain, All Cubs in high spirits, energetically employed on STA ls such as eating, drinking, taking the occasional breath -- with an ear ever cocked for &quot;two clangs&quot; on the bell or &quot;several blasts&quot; on a whistle.&nbsp; </span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="22" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Supper filled the air with the smell of onions, burnt liver -- and jeers from the hungry Cubs for the unfortunate cook. Rumor has it that Kaa is practising for the Operail Also - a word of warning -- we have a beak pincher in the crowd. </span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="23" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">A new method of washing clothes was devised to-day. Whitehood took the Commissioner to the Laundramat known as &quot;Sylvan Lake&quot;. Their method of transpor-tation was a canoe - we believe. The method was to immerse all their clothing in the choppy waters. The only thing that might appear a little unusual was the fact that they were still inside the clothes. Nevertheless, they are to be commended for their great example in &quot;cleanliness&quot;.</span><br />

			&nbsp;</p>

			<p pbzloc="68" style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="67" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">With the White Six providing entertainment, the Pack enjoyed A Sing-Song in the Gilwell Lodge. During the evening, as the humidity proved to be somewhat heavy out-of-doors, all entertainment was held indoors. At the opening of the evening program, Mary Kemp was invested as a Scouter by Akela. We also learned that Baloo&#39;s brother was Assistant Provincial Commissioner, Dick Fowler from St. Albert, who, during the program, entertained us with a most amusing skit. <em>[As the evening wore on and Baloo&#39;s socks slipped, many tired Cubs went to bed</em>] After a cup of coffee, many tired Cubs retired for a damp sleep.</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="58" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Thursday morning, July 25th, got off to a slow start. The Red Flower of the Grey Six did not blossom forth until 5;30 A.M. Many Cubs woke up and wondered if they were floating in the Lake. By 9:00 A.M., all had risen, wrung themselves out and participated in some sort of breakfast. At 8;15 A.M., the White Six were desperately fanning smoke in an attempt to air dry the soaked wood in the cold fireplace. We wonder if the White Six ever did eat more than smoke for breakfast&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="59" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The Grey Six served coffee to the unfortunate White Six early in the morning to encourage them in their hour of trial and also assisted the three Yellow Six damsels in distress, to produce their Red Flower.<br />
			The brave pack watched Akela and Baloo from the windows of Gilwell Lodge, as they broke the flag in the rain this morning. Kaa, in the first session spoke on &quot;The Cub&#39;s Own&quot;. This was followed by a &quot;Cub&#39;s Own&quot; service which was most inspirational.</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p pbzloc="70" style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="66" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Raksha was flying high with her pack on a Games session with Cubs slipping and sliding until [<em>Big Bad John&nbsp;almost broke his n</em>] &nbsp;tripped over his own feet.</span><br />

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="61" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Lunch was served to the hungry Cubs in the Lodge to insure that no one got wet feet.</span><br />

By the way Baloo, as one of our crew reminded you --you can&#39;t gather bugs on the run, you have to sneak up on them, </span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="40" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">We noticed one of our little Cubs went to great trouble to make himself a fine thumbstick which was appropriated by Baloo very early in the afternoon, By the way -- Yellow Six -- we know you are the youngest Cubs in camp, but how could you possibly get lost with a Scout to follow.</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="41" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">We finally &quot;rambled&quot; back to camp where we gratefully grabbed a rest period in which we had nothing to do but build our fires, cook our suppers, build a camrpfire, do a few dozen STA&#39;s (non-existent spare time) retrieve our damp bedding off the clothesline, and change for the evening.</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="42" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">All in all, a full, enjoyable and exciting day for a bunch of tired but happy little Wolf Cubs,</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p pbzloc="44" style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="46" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">A group of city &quot;Cubs&quot; were on a ramble out at Wood camp, One of them, Tom was his name, came upon a heap of empty milk bottles. In great excitement he yelled to his companions: &quot;Hey fellows, come here quick. I found a cow&#39;s nest.</span></p>

(or thereabouts). It was held in great tradition with all the Yellow Six standing at the alert while our &quot;Pet&quot; Sixer did the &quot;Ye-Yo&quot; dance after letting go of the loop. However, our &quot;Master Whistle Blower&quot; who happened to be abit taller, retrieved the rope and with a sigh of relief, all went as taught by the Old Wolves,</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="59" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Upon entering Raksha&#39;s den shortly after, we found it a beehive of activity. Our experiences gained on make up of wounded British soldiers came in real handy as we decorated Raksha&#39;s black eye that had been previously damaged by one of the Bandar-log.</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="60" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The campfire was enjoyed by all including our guests - Mr. Harry Halloway, the Provincial Executive Commissioner for Alberta for the Boy Scouts of Canada and Mr. and Mrs. Ernie Kumm - Ernie being the Provincial Commissioner. Ae should have said &quot;Campfire was enjoyed by all but one&quot; by the name of &quot;Hoot Owl&quot; who was completely fooled by our black eye make-up.</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="61" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The Black Six were in charge of the program with our &quot;German speaking Englishman&quot; acting as Master of Ceremonies,</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="62" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">After campfire, we all gathered at the Gilwell Lodge for &quot;Mug Up&quot; where we saw an interesting film on B-P&#39;s life and some of Gilwell camp in England. This was most inspirational to all concerned,</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="63" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">After another Star Performance of &quot;Three Wood Pigeons&quot;, the Pack retired, or so the Old Wolves thought, It didn&#39;t seem to take them long to find out that the Grey Six had invited us all to coffee before retiring -- again. Here we decided to try the Bandar-log way of life. Several of the monkey people decided to try the &quot;Limbo&quot; as well as the &quot;Twist&quot;. We noticed a few Cubs this morning who were acting more like Shere Khan, Never mind Uppy, John and Mac -- you learned real fast. We wonder why Bagheera was limping around like Chester this morning. He must have been doing some &quot;play acting&quot; and couldn&#39;t find a Mr. Dillon.</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="64" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Sessions started early this morning with the complete &quot;Cub Life&quot; of Johnny Goginheimer portrayed by &quot;little Baloo&quot;. We note that this is the first Cub in Scouting history, whose voice had changed before investiture. This session was followed by a few &quot;Forget your age kids, You&#39;re really a Cub&quot; games conducted by Raksha. We note that Raksha didn&#39;t take part -- she must have spent the night chasing Mickey and Homer - our pet mice. Bagheera took over from here and although his session was real interesting, we all thought his watch had stopped. To add insult to injury -- he conducted his session within a stone&#39;s throw of food and the Q.M. store.</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="65" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">This afternoon&#39;s session was an animated pack meeting with a jungle theme. Many of us wondered if this course had been too strenuous for the Old Wolves when we noticed Kaa and Raksha doing some sort of a squaw rassle in among the trees.</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="69" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Akela decided to give us a real break late this afternoon and gave us a swimming half hour. &quot;Hoot Owl&quot; disillusioned us when he reminded us that we had chicken to cook for supper, This cut the time down to the usual 5 -- 6 minutes.&nbsp;</span><span pbzloc="70" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Many Cubs took advantage of this and stampeded down to the Public Bath Tub. Here all acted in a brainwashed manner and proved they had the real spirit by doing the Dance of Baloo, Ring Around The Rosie, Dance of Baloo, Mowgli and Shere Khan, Dance of Baloo etc. while having their daily baths. We were also given expert instruction on how to float on our back by one Cubs Very well done except that several Cubs were required to rush in retrieve the instructor from the bottom of the lake.</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="74" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Akela called a meeting at seven o&#39;clock and all attended looking rather &quot;well fed&quot; after a chicken supper. Rumbles have it that we ate better than our Scout cooks who had supper cooked for them to-night by a couple of Old Wolves,<br />
			One Cub turned up at the meeting with a new perfume called &quot;Evening In The Garbage&quot; Believe me Helmut -- it won&#39;t sell,</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="85" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">This evenings session ended with the Cubs from the Banana Belt volunteering (Hrmph) to do the Log of Gilwell 1963. Let&#39;s hope we get it so that it can be enjoyed before our reunion in 1965.</span></p>

			<p pbzloc="80" style="text-align: justify"><br />
			<span pbzloc="113" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Campfire to-night was led again by the Staff. There was an air of sadness as we all realized that this was our final one and that to-morrow we would wend our weary ways homeward. I&#39;m sure that each and everyone of us has gained a wealth of information, songs, tricks, handicrafts, etc. that will be a great help in running our Packs and like myself, can hardly wait to start the Pack in September to put all we learned to good use. Here again, we must thank our leaders for their valuable lessons, help and untiring devotion to Scouting in general - and mostly for that extra push that we all appreciated,</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p pbzloc="80" style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="116" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Mr. Harry Halloway made us all feel much better when he presented us with our &quot;badges&quot; to wear proudly, and -Akela finally admitted that we were a fine bunch of Cubs and that he would recommend us all for our Part 11 -Woodbadge.</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p pbzloc="80" style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="117" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The Yellow Six were in charge of the program - this being the second time round, we&#39;re not sure whether the other campfire was just plain enjoyed or they thought we needed the practise most. A skit was put on which sort of &quot;evened&quot; the score with the Staff.</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p pbzloc="80" style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="118" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">After Akela closed the Campfire, we all went down to Gilwell Hall where another sing-song was enjoyed. Mr. Harry Halloway also gave an explanation for his most colorful hat. Baloo introduced two guest Troop Scouters and told us about his first meeting with one of the Troop Scouters who was later to lead us in a couple of songs.</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p pbzloc="80" style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="119" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">We took pity on the tired, overworked Staff who all had work yet to catch up on, and gathered at the lair of the Yellow Six. Here we sang our hearts out til the Black Six remembered that they had some crackers, cheese, cookies and &quot;left-overs&quot; stashed away that they just happened to forget to return to Whitehood. This was a perfect ending to our Gilwell -- even if the cheese had mysteriously disappeared.</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p pbzloc="80" style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="120" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">SUNDAY<br />
			Kaa, bless his heart, started the day off bright and early by clanging the bell at S:30 A.M. Staff had breakfast all prepared so that all Cubs could get an early start -- even if we didn&#39;t want one.</span><br />
			&nbsp;</p>

			<p pbzloc="80" style="text-align: justify"><span pbzloc="121" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">By eight o&#39;clock, Wood&#39;s Park had again settled down to peace and quiet with only the Staff and the odd Cub still remaining.</span><br />
