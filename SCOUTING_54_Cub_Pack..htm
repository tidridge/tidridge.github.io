<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">In 1961 John T was half listening to a conversation between his wife and her friend. He nodded at what he thought were the appropriate places. It turned out he was volunteering to lead the 54<sup>th</sup> Wolf Cub Pack of the Highlands Baptist Church.</p>
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">Thus began 10 years of mostly fun. It brought back memories of his days at St, Mary's Church, Eling, Hants, UK. where Captain Wardle, Church Army, was the Cub Master. John remembers only being sent home for some misdemeanor!</p> 

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">Attending the first meeting John soon discovered that the then leader wanted out and quickly... he must have noted John's obvious skills with the lads... he left shortly thereafter.</p><img src="scout02.jpg" width=300 height=237 vspace=10 hspace=10 align=right alt="Training Camp for Leaders">
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify"> It is fair to say John took full interest in his job, getting all the training he could. He succeeded in earning his Wood Badge which was quite an onerous chore. It meant a week at camp, plus some written material as well. But it was well worth it, learning all the skills a leader needed.</p>
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">At that time the program was the same world wide. It consisted of the cubs learning different skills and finally earning two stars. There simply was not much choice of topic...which at the time John Tidridge thought was OK. In the early sixties a new program developed that gave the boys far more choice and his opinion the easier ones were chosen over the harder tasks. By now he had served ten years and it was time to leave. 
<img src="scout03.jpg" width=100 height=152 vspace=10 hspace=10 align=left alt="John T in full regalia">
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">During the ten years the cubs managed to attend Skeleton Lake Scout Camp on two occasions for a week-long camp. These camps were conducted along military lines and were a great success. It required a great deal of help from parents who were the cooks, nurses and general camp moms. There were two memorable occasions... during the 1965 camp John became a father... and no one showed up with vehicles to take the boys home... it took a world record of cramming boys into two vehicles to get home! It was accomplished.</p>
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">Two other incidents stand out...remember there were three cub packs at the same camp, well separated from each other. One camp signalled all their activities by the use of trumpet blowing. The other pack's senior leader sported a coolie hat which he greatly treasured. We thought it would be a good source of food if we could borrow both items... we succeeded... the trumpet was returned for a plate of cookies.. which we found had been doctored with salt. The other group exacted their 'revenge' at the campfire... our leaders were encouraged to be part of a performance... some how or other we found our faces were daubed with I think grease of some sort... all in good fun!
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">Competition was fierce at cub meetings...the six ( a group of six boys) winning the monthly prize was usually taken on a trip of some sort... the police station, water works, a local radio station and the best one, a trip in the Edmonton City Police aircraft, piloted by classmate Bob Stanton.
