He succeeded in earning his Wood Badge which was quite an onerous chore. It meant a week at camp, plus some written material as well. But it was well worth it, learning all the skills a leader needed.</font></font></font></font></font></p>

It consisted of the cubs learning different skills and finally earning two stars. There simply was not much choice of topic...which at the time John Tidridge thought was OK. In the early sixties a new program developed that gave the boys far more choice and his opinion the easier ones were chosen over the harder tasks. By now he had served ten years and it was time to leave. <img align="left" alt="John T in full regalia" height="152" hspace="10" src="scout03.jpg" vspace="10" width="100" /> </font></font></font></font></font></p>

These camps were conducted along military lines and were a great success. It required a great deal of help from parents who were the cooks, nurses and general camp moms. There were two memorable occasions... during the 1965 camp John became a father... and no one showed up with vehicles to take the boys home... it took a world record of cramming boys into two vehicles to get home! It was accomplished.</font></font></font></font></font></p>

One camp signalled all their activities by the use of trumpet blowing. The other pack&#39;s senior leader sported a coolie hat which he greatly treasured. We thought it would be a good source of food if we could borrow both items... we succeeded... the trumpet was returned for a plate of cookies.. which we found had been doctored with salt. The other group exacted their &#39;revenge&#39; at the campfire... our leaders were encouraged to be part of a performance... some how or other we found our faces were daubed with I think grease of some sort... all in good fun! </font></font></font></font></font></p>

			Greetings Little Brothers! It is now some time since you received the last verbal cuff from the Paw of Baloo. It was just the other day that I was speaking to Akela about how well &quot;Our Cubs&quot; responded to The Old Wolves instruction. You must admit that you were all a rather stickey, spindly lot when you arrived at Sylvan Lake, and it was with pride that Your Old Wolves watched the sleek bunch move off to their distant Lairs at the end of the weeks course. You had learned the Law of the Jungle well and it was with confidence that you left to resume once again, charge of your own Packs. </span><br />

			There is a figure at the centre of this movement, It is the BM Lot us not forget him, as we plan our program in the years to come. You will note that I have used the word &quot;him&quot;4 We cannot gener-alize and just say &quot;thorn&quot; 4 Each boy thinks and acts difforentlyi Each reacts in a different manners Give that personal interest as often as possible. There is sometimes a dangeT of us thinking too much of our-selves. omust guard against this p4ssibilityl Many times a boy will fail us. Let not your belief in him fail4 Your continued confidence in him will give that encouragement which he needs to become a better citizen. There is a great fellowship in Scouting which builds up over the years. It is a splendid thing and lot us develop it further by bringing other people into this Movement. Dedicated men and women are needed. We must encourage those people who arc interested in the development of boys as future good citizens.<br />
			A good Loader must be understanding, compassionate and willing to sacrifice many of his or her own pleasures, Please do not forget your own families as they must not be neglected, Let your personal example be above reproach,<br />
			Now that you have completed Part 11 of the Wood Badge, make it an objective to remain in the Movement for as many years as possible, Pass along what you have learned to the boys and to other Scouters. A great responsibility is yours,<br />
			Nay God bless you in your work and I hope that we will meet again soon,<br />

			<td pbzloc="7">A MESSAGE TO THE COURSE FROM THE PROVINCIAL COMMISSIONER<br />
			(taken on tape when he wasn&#39;t looking)<br />
			Akela and Candidates: This is just one of the finest things that can happen to me -- to come here to a camp where the candidates are participating in a Gilwell course. I don&#39;t know whether you realize it or not, but this particular circle here is a very dear one to me because of all the experiences that I have had here on various courses. I have always looked forward to being among you when you are here taking part in this wonderful experience of&nbsp; Z11,Tell,<br />
			I sincerely hope that, and I would judge from the way you are entering into the campfire, that you are getting something from this Gilwell training which is over and above the regular program. By this I mean, the real Gilwell spirit .... because when B.P. instigated Gilwell, this is what he wanted the candidates to have the real spirit of Scouting and Cubbing. If you go home with that, it matters&#39; not what else you may have learned here because if you have the real spirit, I think that you can overcome just about any obstacle that there is in this movement of ours.<br />
			I don&#39;t think that I have to say anything to you about responsibilities as Leaders because you are all aware, as I am, and all the rest of us who are in this game, just how the Scout Movement is growing in the Province of Alberta. It is just growing by leaps and bounds. For one who gets around as I do and sees the enormous amounts of boys that are still trying to get into our Cub Packs and Scout Troops, it&#39;s a tremendous challenge. Therefore, it&#39;s people like you, who when you go back will really have to carry the cross and help those other Leaders who ha ve not had training, to get it, to follow in your footsteps here to Gilwell in order that they can do a real good job for us also.<br />
			So I hope you&#39;ve had a good week. I know those who are on the team very well and I&#39;m sure, that they have given you some real experiences. These are all dedicated people who are working on the training team and believe me, they; them-selves&#39;, know how difficult it is at times to meet the mark. But if you enter into this program the way you should, and the way I see you are doing, I&#39;m quite sure that you are going to go home and we are going to consider you some of the most successful candidates of Gilwell that we have had.<br />
			Thank you very much,</td>

			The Wolf Cub Pack is different from the Boy Scout Troop. Like Boy Scouting, it has its games, crafts, advancements, a &quot;Good Will&quot; which is like the Scout Good Turn. But the difference is that the Cub activities are what boys 8 to 11 years old like to do, not what Boy Scouts doe, For you will recall when at the Wood Badge Course, it was emphasized, Cubs do not go camping like Boy Scouts, but they do camp, as a family - which of course, is fine experience against the time when they do become Scouts.<br />
			There is a lot of fun ahead of you if you&#39;ll play the game with the Cubs. Be a Leader who pulls - not one who pushes, Help these boys make the best of their Cub years.<br />
			Remember that you are still a Boy Scout - a better Scout because you are a Leader helping boys to become good Cubs and eventually, become good Boy Scouts. Younger boys will imitate you -- follow you. Set them a good example. Above all, be not only their Leader - but their friend,<br />

			Good Hunting,<br />
			KAA, Rod McGeachie,<br />
			Gilwell 1963 was a most _joyous experience. It was truly an original experience...&quot;young&quot; Akela, &quot;yodelling&quot; Baloo, &quot;wise&quot; Kaa, &quot;smiling&quot; Bagheera, &quot;blackened&quot; Raksha, the Bander-log, Slip and Slop, the Pack with an occasional red devil and flipper thrown in,<br />
			This reminds me of a story &quot;Once upon a time, a cook boiled a number of prunes. The prunes were bad so she had to throw them out. A crow, who was sitting on the pump handle, flew over to the garbage heap, picked up a prune, flew back to the pump handle and ate it, He flew off the pump handle, got another prune, flew back to the pump handle and ate it. He continued until all the prunes were gone., He fell off the pump handle - dead.&quot; Moral to the story -- Don&#39;t fly off the handle when you are full of prunes.<br />
			Keep up Good Scouting with plenty of fun and games.<br />
			Sincerely,<br />
			WHITE HOOD, Ross Hallett.</td>

			July 22nd, 1963. The Staff&nbsp;<br />
			On Monday, the 22nd of July, The Gilwell Training Ground was over-shadowed by an early morning overcast. No sign of activity until almost eight-thirty. The hounds, Slip and Slop, had slept in, being exhausted after a strenuous night of &quot;Snipe Hunting&quot;.<br />
			After a late breakfast, Akela and Co., busied themselves getting ready for the incoming course. When it came to raising the new flag pole, Kaa and White Hood had disappeared on one of their many mysterious trips into town.<br />
			Came the time for commencing the Course, tensions grew and at 1:30 P.M. --- HORRORS --- only one cub present and even he disappeared after finding out where the parking lot was. Soon they began to arrive - popping up from all directions. We ended up with 19 Cubs. These were:<br />
			Great Cubs, Small Cubs, Brawny Cubs, Black Cubs, White Cubs, Yellow Cubs, Grey Cubs, Grave Old Plodders, And Gay Young Friskers.<br />
			It must have been the exotic odor of White Hood&#39;s tea served on the lawn according to true Gilwell traditions. They came 300 odd miles from Athabasca in the North and 3 quarts of oil and 4 gallons of gas from Lethbridge in the South.<br />
			A late start but nevertheless, a good one. Thank heaven&#39;s White Hood gave us steak instead of the promised Roast Beef.<br />

			July 23rd, 1963. Yellow Six<br />
			After a successful campfire with entertainment provided by the Staff, &quot;mug up&quot; was held at the Gilwell Lodge with George and Pierre (Slip and Slop) doing the pouring. The &quot;Cubs&quot; from the &quot;tropic zone&quot; found it extremely cold and necessary to use their prized possession &quot;The Hot Water Bottle&quot;. Upon retiring, some of the feminine members decided to warm up by doing the &quot;Twist&quot;. We don&#39;t know what the masculine members did -- but from our camp, they sounded like a bunch of party poopers.<br />
			After a very short night, the day started as early as 5:00 A.M. for some Cubs and as late as 6:00 A.M. for others. The camp ground was a beehive of activity - what with the building of alter campfires, starting-breakfast and heating &quot;bathwater&quot; for the more cowardly Cubs. At nine sharp, the bell tolled to let all &quot;well fed&quot; Cubs know it was time for Flag Break. What-holl! Disaster struck our camp -- the flag was hanging upside down and Akela doesn&#39;t miss a thing. However, after Kaa came to the rescue, the program was underway again. We played a few strenuous games before the Old Wolves saw fit to let us have the results on our Lairs. Baloo wasn&#39;t kidding when he said he&#39;d crack the whip as all pennants were flying very low - about a foot in the ground to be exact, after his daily inspection.<br />
			The afternoon sessions went well until White Hood was put in charge. Never mind, White Hood, the scenery was beautiful, even if it was the wrong trail. The day wasn&#39;t all bad as we all enjoyed the session of &quot;relaxation&quot; while Kaa and Akela proved that it was possible for only two people to put up a wall tent. Thanks Kaa - we&#39;d like more of this sort of thing:<br />
			We&#39;re also&#39;grateful to Raksha -- who knows -- if she hadn&#39;t jumped up and down and shouted, we may never have seen a white rabbit. As for Bagheera (the silent but dangerous type) we feel he should receive a metal of some sort as he was the only one publicly brave enough to try &quot;Cub Coffee&quot;.<br />
			Wolves:<br />
			After one full day of Gilwellj we have one question to ask of the Old<br />
			&quot;One user of outdoor plumbing was relaxing abit when the whistle blew for Lowering of the Flag. What does one do when this situation arises???&quot;<br />
			&quot;Leaders answer for those interested -- &quot;Lower the Boom and Carry on Canada...&quot;<br />

			<p>THIRD BEATS OF THE JUNGLE DRUM<br />
			July 24th, 1963. White Six<br />
			Another enjoyable campfire with Yellow Six entertaining, ably assisted by some members of the Staff:<br />
			&quot;Mug Up&quot; at Gilwell Lodge had an international flavour -- songs from Germany, Denmark and a &quot;dirge&quot; called &quot;Ikely Moor }Mat&quot; -- This is alleged to be the &quot;National Anthem&quot; of the Uncivilized Natives who live North of London, London, England, that is Baloo appears to have &quot;the most frightfully&quot; English accent of the attending &quot;kippers&quot;.<br />
			The &quot;weaker&quot; sex then retired -- and apparently although exhausted, spent the &quot;once again short night&quot;, doing battle with miceil<br />
			Dawn broke -- this time in a solo effort by &quot;Abe&quot; -- no relation to the late lamented president -- joined later by other &quot;tardier&quot; males. The &quot;weaker&quot; Cubs just made it by breakfast time. Flag break was nearly conducted by a &quot;MacAkela&quot;.<br />
			Baloo returned from his daily tour of inspection, looking slightly pooped -- this caused by him having to raise each pennant a &quot;mighty 3 inches. Raksha bearing gifts of money and tobacco - left presumably as bribei, returned to the Parade square where she very kindly distributed her gifts among the Old - Old Wolves.<br />
			Cubs retired for &quot;fairy tales&quot; from Bagheera where we learned of St, George who chased a dragon with a thistle - causing the dragon to step upon a snake whereupon it - the dragon - changed into a fish - and the fish swam away to a lake called &quot;Sylvan&quot;,<br />
			The Cubs re-gathered to be inspected by &quot;Baloo&quot; - who showed great interest in the &quot;gleaming - shining fur&quot; of one of the young Cubs, White Hood having finished inspecting the &quot;fangs&quot; of the Cubs, handed them back to their respective owners:11 Kaa inspected &quot;claws&quot; -- it was rumored the Old Wolves were short of sausages.<br />
			Sometime during the morning the Cubs were &quot;herded&quot; by White Hood into a Stampede. As a new item) we include here the fact that the village of Calgary was named after one particularly bad stampede.<br />
			It was noted at lunchtime, the Old Wolves visited each &quot;grub site&quot;) all with hungry looking faces -- what have &quot;Slip and Slop&quot; been feeding the Old Wolves<br />
			First blood letting of note occurred when a young Cub tried to grub out a tree trunk with her little right toe -- Baloo sent for an adult and first aid was rendered.<br />
			Raksha instructed the Cubs on handicrafts and after the talk, one Cub was noted trying to set several square and clay-like wolves into a Round Parade Circle.</p>

			<p pbzloc="61">THIRD BEATS&nbsp; -- Continued (Who said women were long winded?) Afternoon sessions ended with an overcast sky - chilly wind - and the threat of rain, All Cubs in high spirits, energetically employed on STA ls such as eating, drinking, taking the occasional breath -- with an ear ever cocked for &quot;two clangs&quot; on the bell or &quot;several blasts&quot; on a whistle. &bdquo;,&bdquo; Supper filled the air with the smell of onions, burnt liver -- and jeers from the hungry Cubs for the unfortunate cook. Rumor has it that Kaa is practising for the Operail Also - a word of warning -- we have a beak pincher in the crowd. A new method of washing clothes was devised to-day. Whitehood took the Commissioner to the Laundramat known as &quot;Sylvan Lake&quot;. Their method of transpor-tation was a canoe - we believe. The method was to immerse all their clothing in the choppy waters. The only thing that might appear a little unusual was the fact that they were still inside the clothes. Nevertheless, they are to be commended for their great example in &quot;cleanliness&quot;.<br />
			After a minor fracas in Black Six Area:<br />
			Akela: &quot;Mac, did you kick a nice person like Maggie in the stomache?&quot; Mac: &quot;Please., Akela, I didn&#39;t mean too, and it was her fault.&quot; Baloo to himself: &quot;That isn&#39;t the way I heard it,&quot; Akela: &quot;Well what did Maggie do?&quot; Mac: &quot;She turned around too soon.&quot;<br />
			After lights out one night: Ella: Trley? There&#39;s a mouse squeaking?&quot; Pat: &quot;Well, what do you want me to do, oil it?&quot;<br />
			Irene: rDid you know that -I don&#39;t have all my toes on one foot?&quot; Evelyn: (Sympathetically) &quot;No - How did it happen?&quot; Irene: &quot;I have five on one foot and five on the other.&quot;<br />
			Helmut: &quot;Did you know that Mary beats Uppy up every morning?&quot; Bagheera: &quot;You don&#39;t say;&quot; Helmut: &#39;Nary gets up at 5:30 A.M. and Uppy gets up at 6:00 A.M.&quot;<br />
			One day, while strolling down Jasper Avenue in Edmonton,&nbsp; and not having anything to do for an hour or so, Simone decided to have her fortune told. After going on for 10 or 15 minutes, the fortune teller looked up at Simonno and told her that her future would soon be filled with many fine, handsome men. Her prediction was soon to become true -- as two weeks later, Simonne was a proud leader of a Wolf Cub pack,<br />

			July 25th, 1963, Grey Six<br />
			Apologies to the Grey Six but we, the Log Committee think that youb &quot;First thoughts&quot; are too good to leave out.<br />
			Last evening Baloo&#39;s big brother was seen swimming around the Camp Ground. Following his lengthy swim, we, the Grey Six, had the highly esteemed and coveted honor of shining his slightly dampened clod-hoppers for which we were highly honored at the Pack Sing-Song later in the evenings<br />
			With the White Six providing entertainment, the Pack enjoyed A Sing-Song in the Gilwell Lodge. During the evening, as the humidity proved to be somewhat heavy out-of-doors, all entertainment was held indoors. At the opening of the evening program, Mary Kemp was invested as a Scouter by Akela. We also learned that Baloo&#39;s brother was Assistant Provincial Commissioner, Dick Fowler from St. Albert, who, during the program, entertained us with a most amusing skit. 10-4he ee/4mg-were-en-end-Baleele-seeke-elippe47-ffiany-tred-Glibe-weht-te-1=)ed After a cup of coffee, many tired Cubs retired for a damp sleep.<br />
			Thursday morning, July 25th, got off to a slow start. The Red Flower of the Grey Six did not blossom forth until 5;30 A.M. Many Cubs woke up and wondered if they were floating in the Lake. By 9:00 A.M., all had risen, wrung themselves out and participated in some sort of breakfast. At 8;15 A.M., the White Six were desperately fanning smoke in an attempt to air dry the soaked wood in the cold fireplace. We wonder if the White Six ever did eat more than smoke for breakfast&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
			The Grey Six served coffee to the unfortunate White Six early in the morning to encourage them in their hour of trial and also assisted the three Yellow Six damsels in distress, to produce their Red Flower.<br />
			The brave pack watched Akela and Baloo from the windows of Gilwell Lodge, as they broke the flag in the rain this morning. Kaa, in the first session spoke on &quot;The Cub&#39;s Own&quot;. This was followed by a &quot;Cub&#39;s Own&quot; service which was most inspirational.<br />
			Raksha was flying high with her pack on a Games session with Cubs slipping and sliding until Big Bad John a1meet-et-eke-44e-ne tripped over his own feet.<br />
			Lunch was served to the hungry Cubs in the Lodge to insure that no one got wet feet.<br />
			This afternoon, Akela, the Kernel, and Baloo, the Station Sargent Majer, conducted Field Manoeuvres with the Cubs reminiscent of the Boer War and the Siege of Maf eking. Winding the Seige up, everyone went for a bath in the near by Foot Tub - Sylvan Lake,<br />
			A hearty supper was enjoyed by all.</td>

			July 26th, 1963, Black Six&nbsp;<br />
			t 21:00 hours on Thursday 2v.ning, the Tom-Tan was passed&nbsp; over to the Black Six, -t our cEmpfire, kA_a presented us with food for thought in his talk to us. Tom presented us with thoughts of a different typo -- his ditty on worms want down well, This was followed by &quot;Mug Up&quot;, Quito a jolly duo.<br />
			This morning was rise and shine to a fine day for a change. Our first session was a talk on Proficiency badges by Baghecra -- we sure enjoyed that lively discussion that followed BaghocraU1 During noon brook, we saw two Bandcrlog in the trees in the vicinity of the Lodge, Baloo warned about the possible visitation of the hordes. Chile, the Kite, volunteers to carry out a rescue job, Reports are that those arc probably only two Scouts of the main body spotted some miles away, Also during our noon break, we had a very pleasant visit from White Hood -- not one of those quick &quot;pop in what can T find wrong&quot; visits but a nice long social coffee break and we certainly enjoyed it for a chango. After lunch, we all trotted off through the woods for an &quot;Expodition&quot;. Our Loaders are a jolly bunch in the wide outdoors -- first they walk us for twhilc -- then they run us around in what they gloofully call a &quot;wido game&quot;. Then they walk us a couple of miles more, with bottles of bugs in our hands, and then off we go again on another jungle dance, We are now beginning to fool like fat sleepy bears, ourselves. By the way Baloo, as one of our crew reminded you --you can&#39;t gather bugs on the run, you have to sneak up on them, We noticed one of our little Cubs went to great trouble to make himself a fine thumbstick which WES appropriated by Baloo very early in the afternoon, By the way -- Yellow Six -- we know you are the youngest Cubs in camp, but how could you possibly got lost with a Scout to follow.<br />
			We finally &quot;rambled&quot; back to camp where we gratefully grabbed a rest period in which we had nothing to do but build our fires, cook our suppers, build a carrpfiro, do a few dozen ST/,&#39;s (non-existent spare time) retrieve our damp bedding off the clothesline, and change for the evening.<br />
			All in all, a full, enjoyable and exciting day for a bunch of tired but happy little Wolf Cubs,<br />
			A group of city &quot;Cubs&quot; were on a ramble out at Wood camp, One of them, Tom was his name, came upon a heap of empty milk bottles. In great excitement he yelled to his compan7l_ons: &quot;Hey fellows, come here quick. I found a cow&#39;s nest</td>

			<td pbzloc="258">SIXTH BEATS OF THE JUNGLE DRUM July 27th 1963. Yellow Six Flag break was held promptly at 7:50 P.M. (or thereabouts). It was held in great tradition with all the Yellow Six standing at the alert while our &quot;Pet&quot; Sixer did the &quot;Ye-Yo&quot; dance after letting go of the loop. However, our &quot;Master Whistle Blower&quot; who happened to be abit taller, retrieved the rope and with a sigh of relief, all went as taught by the Old Wolves,<br />
			Upon entering Raksha&#39;s den shortly after, we found it a beehive of activity. Our experiences gained on make up of wounded British soldiers came in real handy as we decorated Raksha&#39;s black eye that had been previously damaged by one of the Bandar-log.<br />
			The campfire was enjoyed by all including our guests - Mr. Harry Halloway, the Provincial Executive Commissioner for Alberta for the Boy Scouts of Canada and Mr. and Mrs. Ernie Kumm - Ernie being the Provincial Commissioner. Ae should have said &quot;Campfire was enjoyed by all but one&quot; by the name of &quot;Hoot Owl&quot; who was completely fooled by our black eye make-up.<br />
			The Black Six were in charge of the program with our &quot;German speaking Englishman&quot; acting as Master of Ceremonies,<br />
			After faml:f:.re, we all gathered at the Gilwell Lodge for &quot;Mug Up&quot; whe&#39;ie we saw an interesting film on B-P&#39;s life and some of Gilwell camp in England. This was most inspirational to all concerned,<br />
			After another Star Performance of &quot;Three Wood Pigeons&quot;, the Pack retired, or so the Old Wolves thought, It didn&#39;t seem to take them long to find out that the Grey Six had invited us all to coffee before retiring -- again. Here we decided to try the Bandar-log way of life. Several of the monkey people decided to try the &quot;Limbo&quot; as well as the &quot;Twist&quot;. We noticed a few Cubs this morning who were acting more like Shere Khan, Never mind Uppy, John and Mac -- you learned real fast. We wonder why Bagheera was limping around like Chester this morning. He must have been doing some &quot;play acting&quot; and couldn&#39;t find a Mr. Dillon.<br />
			Sessions started early this morning with the complete &quot;Cub Life&quot; of Johnny Goginheimer portrayed by &quot;little Baloo&quot;. We note that this is the first Cub in Scouting history, whose voice had chF,nged before investiture. This session was followed by a few &quot;Forget your age kids, You&#39;re really a Cub&quot; games conducted by Raksha. We note that Raksha didn&#39;t take part -- she must have spent the night chasing Mickey and Homer - our pet mice. Bagheera took over from here and although his session was real interesting, we all thought his watch had stopped. To add insult to injury -- he conducted his session within a stone&#39;s throw of food and the Q.M. store.<br />
			This afternoon&#39;s session was an animated pack meeting with a jungle theme. Many of us wondered if this course had been too strenuous for the Old Wolves when we noticed Kaa and Raksha doing some sort of a squaw rassle in among the trees.<br />
			Akela decided to give us a real break late this afternoon and gave us a swimming half hour. &quot;Hoot Owl&quot; disillusioned us when he reminded us that we had chicken to cook for supper, This cut the time down to the usual 5 -- 6 minutes.<br />

			Many Cubs took advantage of this and stampeded down to the Public Bath Tub. Here all acted in a brainwashed manner and proved they had the real spirit by doing the Dance of Baloo, Ring Around The Rosie, Dance of Baloo, Mowgli and Shere Khan, Dance of Baloo etch while having their daily baths ,Ne were also given expert instruction on how to float on our back by one Cubs Very well done except that several Cubs were required to rush in retrieve the instructor from the bottom of the lakes<br />
			Akela called a meeting at seven o&#39;clock and all attended looking rather &quot;well fed&quot; after a chicken supper. Rumbles have it that we ate better than our Scout cooks who had supper cooked for them to-night by a couple of Old Wolves,<br />
			One Cub turned up at the meeting with a new perfume called &quot;Evening In The Garbage&quot;e Believe me Helmut -- it won&#39;t sell,<br />
			This evenings session ended with the Cubs from the Banana Belt volunteering (Hrmph) to do the Log of Gilwell 1963. Let&#39;s hope we get it so that it can be enjoyed before our reunion in 1965._</td>

			<td pbzloc="268">NOTE IN CLOSING OUR LOG<br />
			Campfire to-night was led again by the Staff. There was an air of sadness as we all realized that this was our final one and that to-morrow we would wend our weary ways homeward. I&#39;m sure that each and everyone of us has gained a wealth of information, songs, tricks, handicrafts, etc. that will be a great help in running our Packs and like myself, can hardly wait to start the Pack in September to put all we learned to good use. Here again, we must thank our leaders for their valuable lessons, help and untiring devotjen to Scouting in general - and mostly for that extra push that we all appreciated,<br />
			Mr. Harry Halloway made us all feel much better when he presented us with our &quot;badges&quot; to wear proudly, and -h.kela finally admitted that we were a fine bunch of Cubs and that he would recommend us all for our Part 11 -7gbodbadge.<br />
			The Yellow Six were in charge of the program - this being the second time round, we&#39;re not sure whether the other campfire was just plain enjoyed or they thought we needed the practise most. A skit was put on which sort of &quot;evened&quot; the score with the Staff.<br />
			After Akela closed the Campfire, we all went down to Gilwell Hall where another sing-song was enjoyed. Mr. Harry Halloway also gave an explanation for his most colorful hat. Baloo introduced two guest Troop Scouters and told us about his first meeting with one of the Troop Scouters who was later to lead us in a couple of songs.<br />
			took pity on the tired, overworked Staff who all had work yet to catch up on, and gathered at the lair of the Yellow Six. Here we sang our hearts out til the Black Six remembered that they had some crackers, cheese, cookies and &quot;left-overs&quot; stashed away that they just happened to forget to return to Whitehood. This was a perfect ending to our Gilwell -- even if the cheese had mysteriously disappeared.<br />
			SUNDAY<br />
			Kaa, bless his heart, started the day off bright and early by clanging the bell at S:30 A.M. Staff had breakfast all prepared so that all Cubs could get an early start -- even if we didn&#39;t want one.<br />
			By eight o&#39;clock, Wood&#39;s Park had again settled down to peace and quiet with only the Staff and the odd Cub still remaining.<br />
			THUS EIDETH_LNOTHER GILWELL PART 11 COURSE one, that just can&#39;t be beat ever.</td>
