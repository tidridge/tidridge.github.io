						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">On Sunday, September 15, 1946, at 8.00 p.m. a voice was heard on CKUA making an announcement that would become a standard opening phrase: &quot;Good evening ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Continental Musicale, an hour of European music and songs. I&#39;m your host, Gaby Haas&quot;.</font></font></p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">On Sunday, September 21, 1986, at 8.00 p.m. - for the 2081 st time - this same voice welcomed listeners to the same program. That marked the beginning of Gaby&#39;s 41 st year of broadcasting his program to Albertans, sharing with them a wide variety of recordings both old and new.</font></font></p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Gaby emigrated to Canada from Czechoslovakia in July 1939, and his radio career began that same year. For quite a while, he played in bands, often juggling gigs with radio shows. He recalls those early days with a smile: &quot;We were playing on five radio stations at a time, making anywhere from $3 to $5 a show - a lot of money in those days. At that time, a full-course meal, including pie and coffee, was only 35 cents.&quot;</font></font></p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Gaby actually began his CKUA career in 1940, when the station was located on the U of A campus. He had about 50 records he had brought over from Europe. The music he plays is still his own, but the collection has expanded to include about 35,000 selections that he stores at home.</font></font></p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">In 1945 Gaby played on &quot;Alberta Ranch House&quot;, a program that was carried by the CBC Trans-Canada network from Vancouver to Montreal. He has fond memories of fellow performer Ameen (King) Ganam, who went on to start &quot;Country Hoedown&quot; on CBC. After King Ganam went east, Gaby became leader of the band, changing its name to the &quot;The Barn Dance Gang.&quot; (Former CKUA sportscaster Art Ward played trombone with this band from 1945 to 1946.) Gaby recalls Harry Boone&#39;s contribution to the program with a mischievous smile. &quot;He used to arrange our music. The man was very good, but the arrangements he wrote were tough. He knew that I couldn&#39;t read music very well = not enough to hurt my playing.&quot;</font></font></p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Gaby Haas is well known throughout Canada and the United States as Canada&#39;s &quot;Mr. Polka&quot;. He has released 57 record albums and is looking forward to &quot;50 years on Radio, 40 years on records, and 35 years on TV,&quot; All this will happen in 1989 and then, having achieved nice, round figures&quot;, I&#39;ll retire.&quot; With some of his albums being re-released, Gaby&#39;s music will be heard for many years to come.</font></font></p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">The future? All the pertinent data on &quot;Continental Musicale&quot; has been forwarded to the editors of the &quot;Guinness World Book of Records&quot; in England. The New Zealand supplement to that publication lists a radio program in Wellington that was launched July 2, 1937, and ended on July 4, 1977 - but Gaby has topped that one. On that September Sunday in 1986, Gaby has established a new record: the longest-running radio program in the world - same air time, same day of broadcast, same host and producer.</font></font></p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Mr. Haas is a Canadian recording artist with the distinction of having produced the largest number of records by any Canadian artist; to date he has recorded 51 albums. Besides being an accomplished musician, Gaby has a rare and comprehensive record collection containing over 100,00 &quot;ethnic&quot; records.</font></font></p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">For 15 years, he has produced a weekly radio program called Polka Party. This program can be heard on several Canadian radio stations. Before that time, he produced a program called Memories of Europe, where he played music from all the European countries.</font></font></p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">For Q.C.F.M. Gaby produces The World Showcase of Music, a mixture of music from all corners of the world. On a weekly basis he receives newspapers and letters from most of the European countries, subscribes to European music magazines., as well as most Canadian music publications.</font></font></p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">In addition to being an expert on music around the world, Gaby speaks eight languages fluently, and reads several more. Since starting his program Gaby has also generated interest from the Ethnic communities to produce their own programs. So far Gaby features a Pakistani Program, an Arabian Program. A German Features, A Scandinavian Show, and is presently negotiating a Chinese Show.</font></font></p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="arial" size="3">Daily, Gaby does on hour request show, taking calls from listeners and playing their favourite music from &quot;home&quot;, occasionally inserting some good old Canadian recordings.</font></font></p>
